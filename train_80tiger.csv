tredence,,,"Most leaders are preparing for the wrong version of AI.
Because agentic systems aren’t coming, they’re already rewriting the playbook.
These aren’t just smart tools. They’re systems that understand intent, make decisions, and evolve on their own.
This shift isn’t incremental, it’s structural. And it’s redefining how value is created, how businesses scale, and what leadership must become.
 
Our Agentic AI playbook: Transcending Leadership in the Agentic AI Era isn’t a guide to “adopting AI.”
It’s a strategy manual for navigating:

• The move from human-in-the-loop to human-above-the-loop
• The reorganization of teams, tech, and trust
• The mindset shift from command-and-control to co-evolution
 
Built on real-world transformation work. Framed through five powerful leadership lenses.

We strengthened our position at the center of the cloud ecosystem. Named Partner of the Year by Google Cloud, Snowflake, and Databricks, we weren’t just recognized — we were trusted to lead, across markets and across years. And that trust turned into action.
 
We co-launched some of the most forward-looking products in the enterprise stack: Google’s Conversational Analytics API, Snowflake’s Openflow, and Databricks’ Data Intelligence for Marketing. These weren’t just integrations. They were proof that we’re shaping how modern enterprises listen, learn, and act.
 
We launched Customer 360 — a product born from everything we’ve learned about real-world CX complexity — and acquired Further Advisory to bring sharper strategy to the table. One move scaled intelligence, the other deepened insight.
 
As we built, others took note. Forrester named us a Leader across three categories in customer analytics. CNBC spotlighted our perspective on what enterprise AI should actually look like. And our people-first culture earned national recognition — from being ranked #4 among the best firms for women in tech to winning gold for learning, upskilling, and innovation.

tredence,,,"Mehra Meets Mehta: A Fireside Chat to Remember at Infinity AI Summit!

As the grand finale of Infinity AI Summit, we witnessed an extraordinary conversation between Sumit Mehra and the legendary Boman Irani. More than an actor, Boman is a storyteller who brings wisdom, humor, and deep life lessons to every conversation.

He took us through his inspiring journeyâ€”from his humble beginnings to overcoming dyslexia, all with the unwavering support of his mother. His words carried a universal truth: success isnâ€™t just about talent, but about attitude, perseverance, and perspective.

For two days, we explored the limitless potential of AI and how it is shaping the world. But Bomanâ€™s storytelling reminded us of something profoundâ€”while AI can revolutionize industries, there are aspects of human experience that remain irreplaceable: emotions, empathy, and the art of storytelling.

tredence,,,"At Infinity AI Day 2, the conversation took a powerful turn with AI for Her:

Leading with Purpose and Impactâ€”a thought-provoking discussion on women in AI, data biases, and leadership. Moderated by Rashmi Tambe, Head of Digital Engineering at Tredence, the session brought together inspiring voices: Amruta Joshi (Google Cloud), Radhika Kannan (Intuit), and Smita Naveen (SAP).

The panel delved into the topic of bias in AI, examining how AI often reflects societal inequalities and why ensuring data quality is essential in every AI product. The speakers highlighted how traditional assumptions, such as leadership positions being dominated by one demographic, shape AI systemsâ€”and stressed the importance of including diverse perspectives to help reshape the AI landscape.

The conversation also addressed imposter syndrome, the reluctance women sometimes feel about pursuing careers in AI, and the empowering potential of low-code/no-code solutions in democratizing access to AI, making it more inclusive and accessible to all.

The message was clear: avoiding AI is a risk, and itâ€™s time for more women to step forward, claim their expertise, and take the lead.

More insightful sessions, visionary speakers, and game-changing ideas are coming up.

With rising life expectancy, professionals must reskill, upskill, and embrace lifelong learning to stay relevant. In this era, survival wonâ€™t be about degreesâ€”itâ€™ll be about adaptability.
 
Abhay also emphasized that organizations must evolve too, treating employees as professional spouses, actively supporting their growth and continuous learning.

tredence,,,"What started as a humble dream with just six people in a small apartment has grown into something far beyond what we couldâ€™ve ever imagined. When I take a moment to look back, it fills me with a deep sense of gratitude and humility. The strides we've made have been nothing short of extraordinary. Iâ€™ve always believed that weâ€™d rather be the worldâ€™s best than the worldâ€™s largest, and I can proudly say weâ€™re on the brink of realizing that vision.

Today, I am absolutely thrilled to announce that Iâ€™ll be attending the first-ever First-of-its-Kind Agentic AI Experience Summit â€“ Infinity AI, hosted by Tredence at our Bangalore office. This incredible two-day event, happening on March 27th and 28th in Bangalore, brings together pioneers from all corners of the AI world: leaders, enterprises, government officials, policymakers, and practitionersâ€”all united by the boundless potential AI holds.

Infinity AI will explore the ways Agentic AI is revolutionizing decision intelligence for enterprises, the preparedness required to embrace this seismic shift, and the relentless learning that keeps us ahead in the ever-evolving AI landscape. Itâ€™s a true reflection of our core belief in institutionalizing analyticsâ€”not just as a concept, but as a living, breathing practice.

tredence,,,"Back in 2010, I saw a massive shift coming in the world of data and analytics. It sparked a question in my mind - what if we could build something different, something that truly moves the needle? That spark turned into a journey. We officially got going in 2012, landed our first major client in 2013, and incorporated the company in 2014. In our first year, we were just six people.

Today, Tredence is a team of 3500+ bold, brilliant minds, driving impact across industries.

What sets us apart over the years is simple - we close the gap between strategy and analytics. Weâ€™ve made it our mission to simplify the complex and to scale what works. For us, itâ€™s always Day 1. Every day brings fresh challenges, new ideas, and the chance to do things better.

The world is shifting rapidly. AI is no longer a nice-to-have - itâ€™s at the center of how businesses evolve. And as that gap widens between the AI leaders and the rest, weâ€™re choosing to lean in. Weâ€™re investing 10% of our annual revenue into building next-gen GenAI and Agentic AI capabilities - because we believe this technology will reshape how companies work, how communities thrive, and how we all grow.

And I couldnâ€™t be more excited to share that Tredence is hosting its first-ever Infinity AI Summit on March 27th and 28th in Bangalore. Itâ€™s more than just an eventâ€”itâ€™s a moment. A chance to meet the thinkers, builders, and leaders shaping the future of AI.

While 88% of AI POCs fail to scale and 40% of agentic AI projects face cancellation by 2027, the issue isn't the technology. It's the approach.
 
At MathCo, we've identified how enterprises can move from AI experimentation to enterprise-wide transformation.
 
The answer? Systemic AI, a programmatic framework that embeds intelligence across your entire organization, not just in isolated pockets. 
 
What makes Systemic AI different?
✅ Purpose-driven: Aligned with strategic outcomes, not just technical capabilities 
✅ Context-aware: Grounded in your unique business workflows and institutional knowledge 
✅ Enterprise-scale: Designed for cross-functional orchestration, not departmental silos 
✅ ROI-focused: From action-oriented tasks to outcome-driven transformation 
 
Our new white paper breaks down: 
→ The 5-stage AI maturity framework 
→ Core architectural principles of Systemic AI 
→ Real implementation roadmaps 
→ How to move from fragmented tools to integrated intelligence 
 
Most organizations aren't failing at AI. They're succeeding at the wrong level.
 
It's time to shift from pilots to systems, from experiments to enterprise transformation.

Anuj Krishna, Cofounder and President, MathCo, breaks down the four critical governance questions organizations must answer:

Context: What does a central group own? How do business groups collaborate? How do feedback loops work?

Agents: How do you use existing agents? What needs to be built? Who owns what?

Orchestration: Who owns the framework? What kinds are needed? How do you apply it in business?

Interface: How do you design with users and personas in mind to make it real for them?

Each layer needs its own roadmap, governance model, and clear ownership. Or your AI system won't scale.

mathco,,,"We recently brought together industry analysts and ecosystem partners at MathCo's Intelligence Hub in Bengaluru for a full-day event dedicated to exploring the state and future of enterprise AI transformation.
 
The reality is concerning: 88% of AI proof-of-concepts don't scale to enterprise-wide deployment, and only 25% of AI initiatives deliver expected ROI.
 
Companies invest heavily in experimentation, only to see initiatives remain isolated, fail to integrate with core processes, or struggle to demonstrate sustained value. Organizations lack a holistic framework that goes beyond individual use cases to address how AI integrates into core systems and decision-making workflows.
 
This is precisely the challenge that Systemic AI addresses.
 
Our newly launched framework, implemented through our platform NucliOS 4.0, provides a comprehensive blueprint for moving beyond PoCs to achieve genuine enterprise-wide transformation.
 
The response from analysts during our hands-on sessions and demonstrations was exceptionally encouraging, sparking deep discussions about how this approach solves the scaling challenges they're witnessing across industries.

mathco,,,"Charlie Madison began playing piano at six, encouraged by his parents, who hoped music might offer him a gentle focus and a new way to engage with his surroundings. “I was always told that rhythm and melody could help my senses connect,” he shares. Those early lessons were more than just notes—they were a lifeline, a way to find comfort and confidence.

As Charlie grew, his relationship with the piano shifted. “At night, after my family fell asleep, I’d play and sing songs from my favorite singer-songwriters,” he remembers. While he practiced classical pieces during the day, those nightly sessions were different. “Expressing myself musically felt like a secret, a safe space away from the pressures of being the nerdy kid in a sports-focused town.” The piano became his refuge, allowing him to find his own voice at a time when he felt like an outlier.

Charlie credits the piano with teaching him the value of patience and consistent effort. “Repetition, repetition, repetition—that stuck with me, whether I’m practicing a piece or debugging a tough line of code. Artistry comes from showing up and working through the details.” He’s carried that mindset into his work at MathCo, taking pride in his focus and high standards, while also learning to embrace progress over perfection. “In live performances, even if you make a mistake, you keep going. Most people won’t notice, and stopping just breaks the spell.”

For Charlie, music has always been about community—memories of high school musicals, singing telegrams with friends, and small moments of validation, like the coffee shop owner who once wrote,“ It’s clear you have a lot of poetry and music in you.” Those words still mean the world.

And for anyone looking to learn piano as an adult, Charlie offers this advice: “If you want to play a few favorites, have fun! But if you want to learn truly, don’t skip the basics. They’re the key to unlocking everything music has to offer.” His journey is proof that patience and a love of the process can open doors—at the piano and beyond.

""If I had to describe what drew me to People & Operations, it was the chance to create meaningful employee experiences, design long-term solutions, and align talent strategy with business goals, all while working across functions and learning from different perspectives.""

But it was the visit to Kabini and the BRT Tiger Reserve that changed everything. ""Something about watching animals in their natural habitat just clicked. I realized this wasn't just a hobby anymore—it was something deeper"", he reminisces.

One of his most treasured captures features a leopardess at the Bhadra Tiger Reserve. ""She had just woken up from a nap and was giving us all these poses. But when she yawned, that was pure magic."" Such moments make the long waits worthwhile. ""I've done over 100 safaris in tiger reserves and only seen tigers a couple of times. But when it happens, it's everything.""

Wildlife photography outings are anything but predictable. ""I've spent three hours in a forest without seeing a single bird or animal,"" he admits. ""But that's part of the process. You do your research on animal behaviour and weather patterns, then you wait."" He recalls waiting for a serpent eagle to retrieve its dropped kill, a Russell's viper snake. ""We never got the shot, but the experience itself was incredible.""

For those intimidated by wildlife photography, his advice is simple: ""Start in your backyard. Photograph birds, squirrels, even insects. You don't need to fly to the Masai Mara right away"", he quips.

The unpredictability that makes wildlife photography challenging is also what makes it beautiful. ""Weather changes in an instant, animals don't perform on cue, and opportunities vanish in seconds. But sometimes that 'failed' outing leads to something even better"", he reflects.

Chethan's journey proves that exceptional shots come from showing up consistently with patience and respect. Wildlife photography mirrors life itself—unpredictable, humbling, and ultimately rewarding.

mathco,,,"For Venkatraman G S, Chief Financial Officer at MathCo, every step in his corporate journey has been thought through—taking on challenges, driven by learning, discipline, and the belief that doing what's right for the organization matters more than convenience.

""If I had to sum up my journey in finance, it's been a fantastic one of constant learning, taking on roles that required me to acquire new skills, helping me set up and run multiple functions within Finance and Risk Management, building great teams, and growing as a finance professional.""

""The journey evolved from doing Branch Accounting manually to being part of ERP rollouts, using technology to get real-time financial reports as a CFO for fast-growing companies. Working with inspiring leaders, observing them, and learning what makes them successful.""

Taking on unfamiliar roles became a pattern, each pushing Venky to adapt and grow.

""As I stepped into roles I'd never done before—front-ending client reviews, setting up business finance, or leading Enterprise Risk Management—I realized growth doesn't come from having all the answers. It comes from asking the right questions, preparing well, and surrounding yourself with people you can learn from.""

On what excites him most about MathCo, Venky says, ""I see a younger, high-energy team solving high-growth problems, not just optimization ones. I'm excited to work with leadership to enable MathCo's continued fast-paced growth, both organic and inorganic.""

""As we grow, it would be interesting to use some analytics and forecasting models we offer clients within finance. That's when it gets real: when belief in your product powers your own decisions.""

When it comes to leading teams, he believes in clarity, fairness, and immediate feedback. ""Be direct, be fair, and always offer feedback that helps people grow. Don't wait for reviews; give real-time input to build consistency and trust.""

His advice to young finance professionals? Go beyond numbers.
""Knowing your function isn't enough. Understand your business, the customers you serve, the issues you help solve, and how your work fits the larger value chain. You're not 'just' doing reporting or payroll; you enable the business to succeed.""

He sees the CFO role evolving fast, working closely with CEOs to enable growth and strategy, not just manage financials. ""Technology is transforming how we work, and we must stay ahead. Finance teams must collaborate with engineers, product teams, and data scientists.""

Looking ahead, Venky is energized by MathCo's momentum. ""It's been a great start. We're solving good problems. I'm here to help scale the company, strengthen governance, and support leadership as we build the next phase of growth.""

For Venky, one thing holds true: ""Success isn't about getting everything right, it's about getting better every day and doing what's right for the organization, not what's convenient.""

""Through my academic journey, I explored both the worlds of social work and corporate HR. Interning in both spaces gave me a deep understanding of how empathy and execution go hand in hand when you're working with people.""
 
""I knew I wanted to be part of a company that valued both learning and people-oriented, yet open to fresh ideas. That's when I found MathCo.""
 
Starting his career here as a fresher in Talent Acquisition, Isaac describes the experience as fast-paced, dynamic, and incredibly rewarding.
 
""People often think TA is all about sourcing and numbers, but it's much more than that. It's about understanding where talent fits, communicating across stakeholders, and, most importantly, creating meaningful candidate experiences.""
 
He shares how MathCo's flat hierarchy helped him feel included from day one. ""Even as a fresher, I got to interact with leaders, understand business goals, and contribute in real ways. There's space here to speak up, learn continuously, and grow through every challenge.""
 
""What I value most is the support system, the mentors who guide you, the team that always has your back, and the belief that your work matters, no matter your designation.""
 
Looking back, Isaac says, ""MathCo gave me the foundation, exposure, and confidence to build a meaningful career in HR.""

mathco,,,"""I received my undergraduate degree in English from Penn State and thought my career would be in journalism or copywriting,"" says Catherine Laborde, Head of Human Resources and Operations at MathCo. ""It wasn't until someone I worked for said, 'Have you considered working in HR? You could turn it on its head with your people skills, conversational style, and analytical brain.' That one comment opened a door I hadn't considered.""

Catherine began her HR journey nearly 15 years ago at a large specialty food store in Philadelphia, supporting a bustling catering business and shipping warehouse.

""My office was directly above the store, which gave me an up-close view of the people's experience,"" they recall. ""I dove into hiring, problem-solving, and day-to-day support. It was HR in its most hands-on, human form"".

Since then, they've built a career that spans marketing and advertising, architecture and engineering, and tech sales, always with a people-first mindset. Prior to joining MathCo, they held leadership roles and worked in a global capacity, overseeing the US, Canada, EU, UK, and APAC region, which made MathCo's international team especially appealing.

""What drew me in was the opportunity to continue working on a global scale, but with a team that truly values empathy and intelligence in equal measure.

""Now at MathCo, I oversee Recruiting, Talent, Learning & Development, the overall people experience, and operational people support,"" they explain. ""We're growing quickly, so a big part of my role involves strategic planning and change management, but I never hesitate to roll up my sleeves and get tactical. I love being at work with my team, mentoring them, and seeing them grow and learn.""

What keeps them energized? Creating a culture where people feel safe to bring their whole, authentic selves to work daily.

""One of the most rewarding parts of my job is watching people grow through the organization. Seeing someone step into their potential is what drives me. MathCo has been my home for three years, and being part of its growth story feels like a privilege.""

mathco,,,"“I was never into fitness,” Aritraa says, “but in 2017, a college senior casually nominated me for a marathon—and I just went for it.” She didn’t train or plan, and predictably, didn’t finish with flying colors. But what she walked away with was far more lasting—a quiet spark that soon turned into a full-blown passion. That spontaneous decision kicked off her journey into running, fitness, and the art of showing up for herself. 

Outside of work, Aritraa now finds herself lacing up her shoes more often, pushing her limits, one run at a time. “Over time, running made me feel happy—it gave me a high,” she shares. What began as an experiment quickly grew into a lifestyle. Her training routine includes sprint sessions, strength training, short runs, yoga for flexibility, and maintaining a healthy diet. “I train because I love what I do—and that keeps me going. Consistency has always been my biggest motivator.” 

Before running took over, she often played badminton with friends, especially during school and college. But over time, running took center stage. One of her proudest milestones? Clocking 10 km in 45 minutes at the Pinkathon, her fastest pace so far. “It felt amazing,” she says, “but even more than the timing, it was about the discipline it took to get there.” 

Of course, the journey hasn’t been without its setbacks. A sprained ankle once forced her to pause and question her progress. “I doubted myself, of course,” she admits. “But I kept reminding myself—never give up on yourself. Recovery takes time, and that’s okay.” More than physical endurance, running has built her resilience. It’s helped her stay grounded, gain clarity, and approach both life and work with more confidence. 

To fellow Mathemagicians looking to begin their fitness journey, she offers this: “You don’t need a gym or fancy equipment. It can be as easy as going for a walk or playing a sport you enjoy. You never know when these small things become a routine.” What started as a casual run has now become a non-negotiable part of her life—a source of joy, calm, and above all – a daily dose of self-love. 💙

While 88% of AI POCs fail to scale and 40% of agentic AI projects face cancellation by 2027, the issue isn't the technology. It's the approach.

At MathCo, we've identified how enterprises can move from AI experimentation to enterprise-wide transformation.

The answer? Systemic AI, a programmatic framework that embeds intelligence across your entire organization, not just in isolated pockets.

What makes Systemic AI different?
✅ Purpose-driven: Aligned with strategic outcomes, not just technical capabilities
✅ Context-aware: Grounded in your unique business workflows and institutional knowledge
✅ Enterprise-scale: Designed for cross-functional orchestration, not departmental silos
✅ ROI-focused: From action-oriented tasks to outcome-driven transformation

Our new white paper breaks down:
→ The 5-stage AI maturity framework
→ Core architectural principles of Systemic AI
→ Real implementation roadmaps
→ How to move from fragmented tools to integrated intelligence

Most organizations aren't failing at AI. They're succeeding at the wrong level.

mathco,,,"We recently brought together industry analysts and ecosystem partners at MathCo's Intelligence Hub in Bengaluru for a full-day event dedicated to exploring the state and future of enterprise AI transformation.

The reality is concerning: 88% of AI proof-of-concepts don't scale to enterprise-wide deployment, and only 25% of AI initiatives deliver expected ROI.

Companies invest heavily in experimentation, only to see initiatives remain isolated, fail to integrate with core processes, or struggle to demonstrate sustained value. Organizations lack a holistic framework that goes beyond individual use cases to address how AI integrates into core systems and decision-making workflows.

This is precisely the challenge that Systemic AI addresses.

Our newly launched framework, implemented through our platform NucliOS 4.0, provides a comprehensive blueprint for moving beyond PoCs to achieve genuine enterprise-wide transformation.

The response from analysts during our hands-on sessions and demonstrations was exceptionally encouraging, sparking deep discussions about how this approach solves the scaling challenges they're witnessing across industries.

mathco,,,"Charlie Madison began playing piano at six, encouraged by his parents, who hoped music might offer him a gentle focus and a new way to engage with his surroundings. “I was always told that rhythm and melody could help my senses connect,” he shares. Those early lessons were more than just notes—they were a lifeline, a way to find comfort and confidence.

As Charlie grew, his relationship with the piano shifted. “At night, after my family fell asleep, I’d play and sing songs from my favorite singer-songwriters,” he remembers. While he practiced classical pieces during the day, those nightly sessions were different. “Expressing myself musically felt like a secret, a safe space away from the pressures of being the nerdy kid in a sports-focused town.” The piano became his refuge, allowing him to find his own voice at a time when he felt like an outlier.

Charlie credits the piano with teaching him the value of patience and consistent effort. “Repetition, repetition, repetition—that stuck with me, whether I’m practicing a piece or debugging a tough line of code. Artistry comes from showing up and working through the details.” He’s carried that mindset into his work at MathCo, taking pride in his focus and high standards, while also learning to embrace progress over perfection. “In live performances, even if you make a mistake, you keep going. Most people won’t notice, and stopping just breaks the spell.”

For Charlie, music has always been about community—memories of high school musicals, singing telegrams with friends, and small moments of validation, like the coffee shop owner who once wrote,“ It’s clear you have a lot of poetry and music in you.” Those words still mean the world.

And for anyone looking to learn piano as an adult, Charlie offers this advice: “If you want to play a few favorites, have fun! But if you want to learn truly, don’t skip the basics. They’re the key to unlocking everything music has to offer.” His journey is proof that patience and a love of the process can open doors—at the piano and beyond.

mathco,,,"This World Photography Day, we celebrate how a simple passion can transform the way we see the world. For Chethan, it began quietly in his backyard, photographing cats with a basic point-and-shoot camera.

But it was the visit to Kabini and the BRT Tiger Reserve that changed everything. “Something about watching animals in their natural habitat just clicked. I realized this wasn’t just a hobby anymore—it was something deeper”, he reminisces.

One of his most treasured captures features a leopardess at the Bhadra Tiger Reserve. “She had just woken up from a nap and was giving us all these poses. But when she yawned, that was pure magic.” Such moments make the long waits worthwhile. “I’ve done over 100 safaris in tiger reserves and only seen tigers a couple of times. But when it happens, it’s everything.”

Wildlife photography outings are anything but predictable. “I’ve spent three hours in a forest without seeing a single bird or animal,” he admits. “But that’s part of the process. You do your research on animal behaviour and weather patterns, then you wait.” He recalls waiting for a serpent eagle to retrieve its dropped kill, a Russell’s viper snake. “We never got the shot, but the experience itself was incredible.”
For those intimidated by wildlife photography, his advice is simple: “Start in your backyard. Photograph birds, squirrels, even insects. You don’t need to fly to the Masai Mara right away”, he quips.

The unpredictability that makes wildlife photography challenging is also what makes it beautiful. “Weather changes in an instant, animals don’t perform on cue, and opportunities vanish in seconds. But sometimes that ‘failed’ outing leads to something even better”, he reflects.

Chethan’s journey proves that exceptional shots come from showing up consistently with patience and respect. Wildlife photography mirrors life itself—unpredictable, humbling, and ultimately rewarding.

""While I initially set out to pursue a career in VFX and animation for films, I soon realized my true strength lay in design and creative problem-solving.""

He began his career as a graphic designer at an agency and, within three years, grew into the role of Creative Director. ""Over the years, I've built and mentored design teams, developed process flows, and established SOPs to bring structure and scalability to creative functions.""

MathCo is the third and most structured corporate organisation Deepak has been a part of. ""This role has given me exposure across diverse business functions and the opportunity to lead a dynamic, multidisciplinary design team. We take on complex challenges together, leveraging creativity and collaboration to deliver impactful outcomes.""

What makes the journey even more meaningful for him is the culture at MathCo. ""I've had the chance to learn from inspiring mentors, collaborate with talented colleagues, and guide a team always willing to step up for one another. That spirit of shared ownership and trust makes every project a collective win.""

For him, design goes beyond visuals. ""I'm passionate about shaping meaningful design experiences, building teams that thrive on collaboration, and finding creative solutions to complex business problems. Design isn't just about aesthetics, it's about impact, and I'm excited to keep pushing those boundaries.""

mathco,,,"For Venkatraman G S, CFO at MathCo, every step in his journey has been intentional—taking on challenges, driven by learning, discipline, and the belief that doing what's right matters more than convenience.

""If I had to sum up my journey in finance, it's been one of constant learning, taking on roles that required new skills, helping me set up and run multiple functions within Finance and Risk Management, building great teams, and growing as a finance professional.""

From manually performing Branch Accounting to ERP rollouts to using technology for real-time reporting as CFO for fast-growing companies, Venky learned from inspiring leaders by observing what made them successful.

""As I stepped into roles I'd never done before—front-ending client reviews, setting up business finance, or leading Enterprise Risk Management—I realized growth doesn't come from having all the answers. It comes from asking the right questions, preparing well, and surrounding yourself with people you can learn from.""

On MathCo, he says, ""I see a younger, high-energy team solving high-growth problems, not just optimization ones. I'm excited to work with leadership to enable MathCo's fast-paced growth, both organic and inorganic."" When leading teams, his belief is clear: ""Be direct, be fair, and always offer feedback that helps people grow. Don't wait for reviews; give real-time input to build consistency and trust.""

His advice to young finance professionals? ""Knowing your function isn't enough. Understand your business, the customers you serve, the issues you help solve, and how your work fits the larger value chain.""

He sees CFOs closely partnering with CEOs. ""Technology is transforming how we work, and we must stay ahead. Finance teams must collaborate with engineers, product teams, and data scientists."" Looking ahead, Venky says, I'm here to help scale the company, strengthen governance, and support leadership as we build the next phase of growth.""

For him, one truth stands: ""Success isn't about getting everything right, it's about getting better every day and doing what's right for the organization, not what's convenient.""

A great system doesn’t earn its place because it’s clever, but because people use it.

When design focuses on the human at the other end, technology becomes:

💡 Part of the daily flow, not a disruption
💡 Simple enough to feel second nature
💡 Reliable enough to inspire trust

That’s when innovation makes the leap from impressive to impactful.

mathco,,,"“I was never into fitness,” Aritraa says, “but in 2017, a college senior casually nominated me for a marathon—and I just went for it.” She didn’t train or plan, and predictably, didn’t finish with flying colors. But what she walked away with was far more lasting—a quiet spark that soon turned into a full-blown passion. That spontaneous decision kicked off her journey into running, fitness, and the art of showing up for herself.

Outside of work, Aritraa now finds herself lacing up her shoes more often, pushing her limits, one run at a time. “Over time, running made me feel happy—it gave me a high,” she shares. What began as an experiment quickly grew into a lifestyle. Her training routine includes sprint sessions, strength training, short runs, yoga for flexibility, and maintaining a healthy diet. “I train because I love what I do—and that keeps me going. Consistency has always been my biggest motivator.”

Before running took over, she often played badminton with friends, especially during school and college. But over time, running took center stage. One of her proudest milestones? Clocking 10 km in 45 minutes at the Pinkathon, her fastest pace so far. “It felt amazing,” she says, “but even more than the timing, it was about the discipline it took to get there.”

Of course, the journey hasn’t been without its setbacks. A sprained ankle once forced her to pause and question her progress. “I doubted myself, of course,” she admits. “But I kept reminding myself—never give up on yourself. Recovery takes time, and that’s okay.” More than physical endurance, running has built her resilience. It’s helped her stay grounded, gain clarity, and approach both life and work with more confidence.

To fellow Mathemagicians looking to begin their fitness journey, she offers this: “You don’t need a gym or fancy equipment. It can be as easy as going for a walk or playing a sport you enjoy. You never know when these small things become a routine.” What started as a casual run has now become a non-negotiable part of her life—a source of joy, calm, and above all – a daily dose of self-love. 💙

mathco,,,"""I did my MBA in Marketing and HR and started my career as a management trainee."" says Aparna Nirmalan, Content Associate at MathCo. 
 
""During that time, I realized my strengths lay in marketing communications. I naturally gravitated towards comms and thought leadership projects, and just as I was looking to move into internal communications and talent branding, I came across the opportunity at MathCo.""
 
""Even though it's only been a year here, the learning has been immense."" What stands out most for Aparna is the trust and belief the team places in her.
 
""That belief has helped me believe in myself more,"" she shares. ""I've been encouraged to take on tougher, more challenging projects, and that's pushed me to grow faster than I expected.""
 
""The team works as one. There's no 'your work' or 'my work'; it's always 'our work.' If someone can't manage something, someone else steps in without hesitation.""
 
""It's incredibly empowering,"" she adds.
 She reflects on how exposure to diverse perspectives has reshaped her thinking—encouraging her to question, innovate, and explore bold ideas.

""People often think comms is just sending emails, but there's so much more to it. It's about message design, clarity, timing, what turns a message into something people actually connect with, especially in today's world where everyone's bombarded with information.""
 
Working closely with senior leaders and being part of cross-functional projects has given her a holistic view of communication and valuable stakeholder management experience.
 
""There's also space to fail and figure things out. That freedom to experiment is a huge confidence booster. I've grown as a communicator, yes, but I've also grown as a professional who's learning to think bigger and push harder.""

mathco,,,"When the pandemic brought the world to a standstill in 2020, Radhika B. found an unexpected sanctuary in the quiet world of plants. What began as a way to pass the time soon became a lifeline, filling her home with greenery and her days with purpose. Initially drawn to gardening through YouTube videos, Radhika discovered more than just a hobby-she found a passion that taught her patience and resilience. 
 
Her approach to gardening is intuitive and compassionate. She believes each plant has a unique personality and needs—some thrive under bright sunlight, others demand shade. She groups plants accordingly and practices “intentional neglect”—resisting the urge to overwater because the soil appears dry. Surprisingly, the most challenging plants for her have been succulents. Though often labeled 'low maintenance,' she found them deceptively tricky, requiring the perfect balance of well-draining soil, sunlight, and minimal watering. 
 
Despite space constraints, Radhika has created a thriving indoor oasis in her home. Her collection includes Snake Plants, Monsteras, Palms, and Ficus, while her balcony doubles as a mini vegetable garden with chilies, tomatoes, fenugreek, and mint. She experiments with unusual plants, including Mother of Thousands, a fascinating species that grows baby plantlets along its leaf edges. Sustainability is vital in her gardening philosophy—she repurposes containers, composts kitchen waste, and has a special ""green second chance"" jar for failed plant cuttings. 
 
For Radhika, gardening is more than just growing plants—it's about slowing down and embracing nature's rhythm. ""In a world obsessed with speed, gardening slows you down. It teaches you that real, lasting growth takes time, care, and a bit of faith,” she reflects. As she looks to the future, she hopes to deepen her understanding of soil composition, explore vertical gardening, and venture into hydroponics. For aspiring gardeners, her advice is simple yet powerful: start small. ""Borrow a cutting, find a sunny windowsill, and just begin. Failure is part of the journey, but plants are more forgiving than people think,"" she shares.  For extra guidance, she recommends YouTube channels like ""Garden Up,"" which played a significant role in shaping her green thumb. With every new leaf and unexpected bud, Radhika continues cultivating not just plants but also patience, joy, and a deep connection with nature.

mathco,,,"It's World Art Day—a reminder to pause and celebrate the creativity that enriches our everyday lives. At MathCo, this creativity takes many forms, including in the thoughtful sketches of Design Associate Nikhil, whose artistic journey reveals how art can become both a personal sanctuary and a powerful form of self-expression.

Nikhil's affinity for art began during his school days as a simple pastime. ""I have been sketching since my school days. What once started as a hobby eventually grew to be a form of therapy,"" he shares. Self-taught and driven by curiosity, Nikhil started with simple pictures and gradually progressed to exploring light, shadow, and emotion.

Nikhil's work thrives in the balance between structure and freedom. ""With portraits, I like showing emotions and small details in people's faces. It feels special,"" he explains. ""Abstract is also fun—there are no rules, just whatever I feel in the moment."" His creative process is largely intuitive. ""Sometimes I just start drawing with no plan, and slowly, an idea forms in my head. I like creating things that don't exist in real life—but still feel like they could."" Imagination leads the way, but emotions and real-life experiences shape what eventually takes form on paper.

Like many artists, he's learned to navigate the natural ebbs and flows of creativity. When inspiration wanes, he turns to rest, music, or nature—allowing his creative spark to return organically. Over time, patience has become integral to his process, especially when experimenting with detailed dot work using black pens. ""It takes time, but I enjoy the detail and patience it needs.""

Among his works, one sketch stands out—a warrior woman adorned with feathers, poised with a bow. ""That sketch reminded me of the fighter in me; it wasn't planned—it just came out of how I was feeling,"" he reflects. For Nikhil, art is a quiet conversation—between thought, feeling, and imagination. This World Art Day, we celebrate that voice and art's power to connect us with ourselves and each other.

mathco,,,"Thisâ€¯Women's History Month, we're celebrating women who are shaping a better future for themselves and the world. Sangeetha Kannan, Project Manager at MathCo,â€¯is one such changemaker. Through small yet powerful choices, she champions sustainable living, proving that everyday actions can make a lasting impact.
 
""The world doesn't need a few people doing zero waste perfectly.â€¯What it needs isâ€¯millions of people doing zero waste imperfectly,"" says Sangeetha Kannan.
 
Sangeetha is a staunch believer in this. She shares,â€¯""I set out trying to find small ways in which I could contribute to the betterment of the world.""â€¯Her journey toward sustainability proves that even theâ€¯simplestâ€¯changes can create a ripple effect.
 
One of herâ€¯easiestâ€¯and most impactful shifts wasâ€¯refusing single-use items.â€¯""Pledge to spend a few extra minutes every day, and you'll be well on your way to cutting down on single-use consumption,""â€¯she says. Waste segregation and composting wet waste at home have also been game changersâ€”small efforts that lead toâ€¯significant environmental impact.
 
Sangeetha has incorporated severalâ€¯eco-friendly alternativesâ€¯into her daily routine:

âœ”â€¯Coconut coir & wood-based cleaning brushes
âœ”â€¯Homemade bio enzyme cleanerâ€¯(citrus peels + jaggery + water in a 10:3:1 ratio)
âœ”â€¯Natural tooth powderâ€¯in a glass jar instead of plastic toothpaste tubes
âœ”â€¯Bamboo toothbrushesâ€¯instead of plastic onesâ€¯(Every toothbrush you've ever used still exists somewhere!)
âœ”â€¯Menstrual cupsâ€¯instead of disposable sanitary napkins
âœ”â€¯Kajal in a tin box, used with a wooden applicator
âœ”â€¯Wooden combs (neem/bamboo)â€¯instead of plastic combs
âœ”â€¯Reed diffusers with essential oilsâ€¯instead of artificial air fresheners
 
She left us with some easy steps to reduce single-use items:

âœ”Carry a water bottleâ€¯â€“ Refilling is an easy, sustainable choice, whether it's a short outing or a long trip.
âœ”Use a handkerchiefâ€¯â€“ The next generation needs trees more than we need disposable tissues.
âœ”Keep cloth bags handyâ€¯â€“ Store extras in your vehicle and always carry a few smaller ones.
âœ”Pack food containers & reusable cutleryâ€¯â€“ A small step to avoid unnecessary packaging waste.
âœ”Opt for dining out instead of ordering inâ€¯â€“ Enjoy your meal while cutting down on plastic packaging.
 
Sangeetha's approach is simple:â€¯progress over perfection.â€¯Let's take inspiration from her journey and commit to makingâ€¯sustainable choices, one habit at a time.

mathco,,,"In a world that often demands choosing between passion and profession,â€¯Babitaâ€¯balances corporate life as an HR professional with a deeper calling: using her voice to bridge generations throughâ€¯Konkani culture. Her musical journey began in childhood, shaped by her fatherâ€™s love for global sounds. â€œHeâ€™d send cassettes and CDs from artists worldwide,â€_x009d_ she recalls. â€œOur home was always filled with musicâ€”it was our language.â€_x009d_ Her talent first shone through at a parish singing competition, a pivotal moment that sparked her musical journey.

Babita is drawn toâ€¯timeless songs, â€œTimeless lyrics and melodies stay with you,â€_x009d_ she says. â€œTheyâ€™re like old friends who never leave.â€_x009d_ For 20 years, she has been a pillar ofâ€¯Wilfy Rebimbusâ€™ Sangeeth Gharana, a troupe dedicated toâ€¯Konkani music. â€œWeâ€™re not just performersâ€”weâ€™reâ€¯storytellers,â€_x009d_ she explains. From festivals in India to concerts in Canada, she sharesâ€¯Konkani traditions, calling the language â€œtheâ€¯heartbeat of my art.â€_x009d_
Her mission extends beyond the stage. At home, she writes songs with her husband, a sound engineer. â€œWe want to showâ€¯Konkani cultureâ€¯isnâ€™t just historyâ€”itâ€™s alive,â€_x009d_ she says, planning music videos that blend folk roots with modern flair. Music, for Babita, is more than performanceâ€”itâ€™sâ€¯healing. After singing at church, a listener once told her they felt immense spirituality in her voice. Another fan shared how her song lifted them from despair. â€œThatâ€™s musicâ€™s magicâ€”itâ€¯stitches broken hearts,â€_x009d_ she says. Even in HR, melody guides her. â€œTeams needâ€¯harmony, not just rules,â€_x009d_ she laughs. â€œMusic taught me to listenâ€”not just to words, but to whatâ€™s unspoken.â€_x009d_

Babitaâ€™s journey hasnâ€™t been without challenges, but sheâ€™s inspired byâ€¯resilience. Her message to others? â€œYour potential isnâ€™t a small boxâ€”break it wide open.â€_x009d_ Juggling work and music, she insists balance isnâ€™t sacrifice: â€œItâ€™s choosing what fuels you, daily.â€_x009d_ As Babita preps her debut EP, she dreams ofâ€¯Konkani children worldwideâ€¯hearing her songs and thinking, â€œThatâ€™s my story.â€_x009d_ In her, theyâ€™ll find a beacon: proof thatâ€¯roots and wings can coexistâ€”and that a life lived in harmony is always worth singing about.

mathco,,,"ðŸŒŸ Engineers Week Spotlight: Meet Sravani Budamagunta! ðŸŒŸ

From intern to Cloud Engineer at MathCo, Sravani's story shows how passion meets purpose. She's revolutionizing data solutions one pipeline at a time! Let's dive into her journey below.

1. â€¯Is this your first job straight outta college? Tell us how that happened?

Yes, this is my first job out of college! I joined MathCo as an intern, where I first stepped into the ocean of dataâ€”and never looked back. I now focus on designing and building scalable enterprise data marts and ELT pipelines that turn raw data into actionable insights.

2. Picking between engineering & astronomy - which one gets you more excited?

Tough choice! Engineering is all about creating robust and efficient solutions â€“ which excites me the most. But astronomy offers a unique thrillâ€”exploring the unknown and the vastness of space. If I had infinite time, I'd pursue both!

3. How has your journey been so far in the company?

Itâ€™s been an amazing journey of growth, learning, and collaboration! Iâ€™ve been fortunate to work with a great team that values and recognises both technical excellence and process-driven approaches. Receiving the Excellence Award was a highlight, but more than that, seeing how our work impacts real-world business decisions has been truly fulfilling.

4. How do you balance work with your love for nature?

Itâ€™s all about making time for the little things! I enjoy taking short nature walks to clear my mind. Itâ€™s my way of staying grounded and recharging.

5. What's on your learning list for 2025?

In 2025, Iâ€™m all about mastering the intersection of business and technology to build solutions that drive real impact. Staying ahead of emerging trends will be key, as aligning technology with business goals is essential for long-term success and maintaining a competitive edge.

6. What helped you get better at Data Modeling?

Understanding the core problem weâ€™re solving for customers naturally leads to more effective solutions. The key is to go beyond tables and relationshipsâ€”focusing on granularity, performance, and real-world usability. Once you embrace this approach, it becomes second nature, making data modeling both intuitive and impactful. A clear, holistic view is essential for delivering solutions that are built to last.

I started sharing to keep myself motivated and reflect onÂ what I had learned.Â It's a great way to document my progress, andÂ I find thatÂ sharing my experiences helps me stay accountable.Â Plus, if it resonates with others or sparks a meaningful conversation, that'sÂ an added bonus! It's become a way for me to both inspire and learn from others in the process.

ðŸ”¹Â Your best debugging story?

Oh boy, debugging can be wild! My best story was spending hours tracking down a bug, only to realize it was a typo in a single line of code! But hey, that's what makes theÂ ""Aha!""Â moment worth it.

ðŸ”¹Â One piece of advice from your mentors that stuck with you?

""Be the expert in whatever you're working on.""Â It pushes meÂ to always aim higherÂ and explore beyondÂ what's expected.

ðŸ”¹Â Gen AI is everywhere right now! What's the coolest thingÂ you'reÂ exploring recently?

I worked on an Agentic RAG app with knowledge graphsÂ recently,Â and just discovered KARMAâ€”a multi-agent system that enriches knowledge graphs using LLMs. It'sÂ amazingÂ how it creates high-quality graphs with minimal human effort!

ðŸ”¹Â How's the tech community at MathCo?

Tech communities are close to my heart, and TechMinds is no exception. The learning and collaboration that happen here areÂ amazing. As MathCo's Data Engineering community, it's a fantastic space for sharing knowledge, tackling challenges together, and staying on the cutting edge of new technologies.

ðŸ”¹Â What gets you excited about being a Cloud Engineer?

What excites me the most is the constant learning it brings. I've had the opportunity to dive into multiple tech stacks in a short span, working across different aspects of data pipelines, MLOps, and even Gen AI. The dynamic nature of the role keeps things excitingâ€”there's always something new to explore!

ðŸ”¹Â How do you make time for community stuff with work?

It's all about prioritizing time! I always make time for community activities.Â Whether it's early mornings or weekends,Â I find joy in participating in these spaces.Â It helpsÂ me stay inspired,Â connectedÂ with like-minded individuals, and continue my learning.

mathco,,,"MathCo Solves â€“ Engineers Week Special!

Unplanned downtime in manufacturing? A costly nightmare. But with MathCoâ€™s innovative approach, we helped a pharma manufacturer turn challenges into opportunitiesâ€”reducing costs byÂ 20%!

mathco,,,"Engineers Week Special featuring Tapas Das, Data Architect at MathCo!
 
At MathCo, our engineers don't just build systemsâ€”they solve complex problems, innovate with cutting-edge tech, and push the boundaries of data and AI.
 
We sat down withÂ TapasÂ to talk about his journey, what keeps him inspired, and his top book and game recommendations!
 
1. How did you get into engineering? Was it always the plan?
 
I got into engineering because I've always been fascinated by problem-solving and building scalable systems. Early on, I was drawn to how technology could transform raw data into meaningful insights, and that naturally led me into the world of data architecture.
 
Was it always the plan? Not exactly. While I had a strong inclination towards technology, my specific path into data engineering and architecture evolved over time. Initially, I was more focused on software development, but as I worked with large datasets and complex system designs, I realized that data engineering was where my strengths and interests aligned.
 
2. What made you choose MathCo?
 
I chose MathCo because it aligns with my passion for building scalable, high-performance data architectures and multi-cloud platforms while also providing opportunities to shape MLOps and LLMOps frameworks.
 
A few key reasons stood out are ""Focus on Data & AI"", ""culture of innovation and technical ownership"", ""A Great Team & Vision"".
 
3. How do you manage to game, read, and watch shows?
 
It's all about balance and priorities! Gaming is my go-to for unwinding, especially after a long workday. Currently I'm playing a story-driven game, so I plan it like a mini-seriesâ€”play for an hour or two and continue later.
 
I also keep my Kindle handy to be able to read on the go. Whenever I can squeeze in 20-30 minutes.
 
6. What's your current read? Looking for book recommendations!
 
Right now, I'm reading The Black Dahlia by James Ellroy, and it's keeping me hooked with its perfect mix of suspense, eerie atmosphere, and mind-bending twists. But I'd also recommend these 5 books for different moods and genres.
 
For a slow-burn psychological thriller, The Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides
For sci-fi and mind-bending twists, Dark Matter by Blake Crouch
For dark humor and absurdity, A Dirty Job by Christopher Moore
For layered mysteries, Magpie Murders by Anthony Horowitz
 
7. What's the best thing about being part of the MathCo engineering team?
 
A perfect blend of innovation, collaboration, and technical challenges. There's always an opportunity to experiment with the latest tools in data engineering, ML engineering, and AI-driven optimizations. The focus isn't just on delivering code, it's on building future-proof systems that drive business outcomes. Being part of the MathCo engineering team means working with brilliant minds, cutting-edge tech, and solving real-world challengesâ€”all while having the freedom to innovate, learn, and make a difference.

mathco,,,"""Sometimes, the most meaningful journeys start by chance,"" says Shalini Venkatesh, Talent Acquisition Manager, MathCo. ""When I first stumbled into recruitment, I had no idea it would become my calling. What began as an accident soon grew into a deep passionâ€”finding the right people for organizations and helping them discover roles that let their talents shine. It truly became the best of both worlds. Looking back now, it's clear that recruitment has always been where I was meant to be.""

""Over the past 12 years in Talent Acquisition, my journey has been nothing short of rewarding. Yes, there are endless targets, strict deadlines, and the constant rush to meet hiring goalsâ€”but that's what makes it exhilarating!"" she says with a smile. ""Every day presents new challenges and opportunities. I often tell my team, 'The real joy of recruitment isn't just in filling a role. It's in watching someone grow, thrive, and climb the ladder of success.' The fulfillment in seeing a person evolve in their role and reach their potential is the true reward of this profession.""

""My time at MathCo began six years ago, and during this time, I've had the privilege to play multiple roles. But for me, MathCo is more than just a workplaceâ€”it's a community that feels like home."" Shalini pauses, reflecting. ""Over the years, the bond with my colleagues has been a source of strength and motivation. The work here goes beyond just tasks and deadlines; it's about fostering relationships that make every day meaningful.""

""The reason MathCo holds such a special place in my heart isn't just because of the work I do here. It's the peopleâ€”their unwavering support, their encouragement, and the way they show up for one another that makes it truly unique. Working with such a compassionate, driven team has been incredibly fulfilling, and it's what sets MathCo apart from any other organization.""

""Life threw me one of its hardest challenges when I lost my brother and father to Covid. It was, and continues to be, a deeply painful time for my mother and me. In those darkest moments, MathCo stood by me like a pillar of strength. They didn't just offer words of comfort; they showed up with kindness, understanding, and support. It wasn't just about showing sympathyâ€”it was about being there, providing genuine care when I needed it most.""

""They say, 'It's the people who make all the difference,' and at MathCo, this couldn't be truer."" Shalini's tone is filled with warmth. ""The bonds I've built with my colleagues are not just professionalâ€”they're personal. The sense of community here is unlike anything I've experienced before.""

""To anyone reading this: I hope my story reminds you that meaningful work isn't just about what you doâ€”it's also about who you do it with,"" Shalini says with conviction, her voice filled with gratitude.

AI's transformative power is undeniable, but its impact on HR is particularly game-changing. Why?
 
Daniil Mosin, Principal, MathCo, explains how HR thrives on data-driven insights to manage people, culture, and growth.
 
As organizations shift from descriptive to predictive and prescriptive analytics, HR is leveraging AI to:

âœ” Enhance decision-making
âœ” Optimize operations
âœ” Personalize employee experiences
 
Heading into 2025, here are the top 5 AI trends shaping HR:
 
âœ… Generative AI in talent acquisition: AI models are increasingly used to screen candidates, predict top performers and ""early flight"" risks, and streamline operational processes, like scheduling interviews.

Leading players see a 4x improvement in candidate conversion and a 25% reduction in time to interview via the adoption of AI tools.
 
âœ… Predictive workforce planning: Individual-level attrition prediction and skill-based workforce demand forecasting become critical instruments of workforce planning alongside scenario modeling (e.g., hybrid vs. in-person).

For example, some of the early adopters see a 4% reduction in attrition levels via individual-level prediction and a deeper understanding of influencing factors.
 
âœ… The proliferation of employee wellness and engagement tools: - Personalization of employee experience: AI enables hyper-personalized learning and development plans based on employee performance and individual preferences, which become ever more relevant as the technology pace accelerates.

Employee upskilling and reskilling become more frequent needs, and virtual assistants provide instant coaching and answers to HR-related queries. Additionally, advanced analytics opens opportunities to design better benefits programs based on utilization statistics and employee data.
 
âœ… Organizational modeling and optimization enabled by advanced analytics: Companies leverage advanced analytics to design optimal organizational structures, simulate workforce scenarios, identify efficiency bottlenecks, and streamline operating models.

Most enterprises still treat AI as a decision-support tool. That era is ending. Agentic AI is here. Systems that don’t just analyze data but act on it, at machine speed and scale.

In a recent session with InterviewBuddy™, Niraj Kumar from Mu Sigma explored how this shift is rewriting the enterprise AI playbook:

🤖AI swarms over single models: A2A and MCP protocols let multiple agents collaborate, negotiate, and solve problems.

 ⚙️ Smarter architectures, faster action: MoE and LoRA make agentic systems leaner, cheaper, and more responsive.

In a recent session with InterviewBuddy™, Niraj Kumar from Mu Sigma explored how this shift is rewriting the enterprise AI playbook:

🤖AI swarms over single models: A2A and MCP protocols let multiple agents collaborate, negotiate, and solve problems.

musigma,,,"Mu Sigmaâ€™s Akashic Architecture is its implementation of the Continuous Service as a Software (CSaaS) paradigm. A core component that enables speed in building Systems of Exploration using the Akashic Architecture is muTalos. It is our implementation of agentic AI which will ensure that 60% of all code written in Mu Sigma by 2027 will be non-human.

To understand CSaaS please watch our video. https://lnkd.in/d4NGXjdx

Mu Sigma's first Agentic AI patent dates back to 2014, when we invented a multi-agent event processing system and method that can work with real-time data.

Components of this system include:
âœ… Core Engine - defines and deploys multi-agents to perform tasks using real-time data.
âœ… Monitoring Engine - supervises the agents, tracking their communication, lifecycle, and processing performance.
âœ… Computing Engine - executes the agents' assigned tasks in real-time.
âœ… Batch Processing System - handles tasks that involve non-real-time data.
âœ… Studio Interface - allows users to manage agents, define tasks, and oversee system operations interactively.

Our system used multi-agent coordination, improving resilience, reducing latency and increasing capability in various multi-industry use cases. We knew over a decade ago that speed was the difference between opportunity and loss and our contribution helped transform the deployment of real-time intelligence.

Reduce the cost per question and accelerate decisions with Mu Sigma.

What began as an interest in identifying vulnerabilities evolved into a commitment to safeguarding public trust and preserving individual freedoms in an ever-more interconnected world.

Today, her mission translates into embedding security into every layer of Fractal’s work: from Zero Trust architecture and DevSecOps to AI-enabled monitoring, Responsible AI frameworks, and risk-driven policies. In a world where cyber warfare, digital fraud, and adversarial AI are increasingly prevalent, security cannot be an afterthought, it must be built in by design.

For Priya, balancing business growth with trust, cultivating a culture of security-conscious teams worldwide, and rigorously vetting third-party partners are all part of the playbook. Her leadership style focuses on creating systems that are both elegantly secure and empowering, enabling people to innovate without fear.

As part of her personal discipline, she dedicates ten minutes each morning to journaling and identifying her top three priorities for the day. This sharpens her purpose and aligns her actions with the overarching mission.

For those entering the field, her advice is timeless: stay curious, keep learning, and master not just technical depth but also empathy, communication, and clarity.

fractal,Thought Leadership - Flagship,Newsletter,"Prarthana’s journey began with data analysis, uncovering patterns. When her firm needed a Human Capital leader in Europe, she stepped forward, asking, ""Why not me?""

At first, leadership meant structure, designing processes, streamlining systems, and building frameworks to keep the organization humming. But Prarthana realized that true impact comes from blending data-driven insight with empathy and human connection.

With experience across three continents, she has learned how culture shapes the way people work and connect and is able to translate global strategies into local action. Through initiatives like ‘Thriving Together’ and ‘EmpowerHER’, she’s built a workplace where people talk openly about mental health, support each other, and thrive.

Her approach to leadership development is practical and inclusive: Whether it’s regional town halls, coffee mornings, or CSR initiatives, she creates moments that connect people and remind them they’re part of something bigger.

She believes leadership isn’t about having all the answers but asking the right questions, and empowering others to discover their own solutions.

In the fast-moving world of analytics and AI, Prarthana believes Human Capital’s role is to guide people through change, build learning pathways, and ensure innovation happens not just in technology, but in how people are supported and enabled to grow.

When you lead with both mind and soul, you don’t just grow a business - you cultivate a culture where everyone has the chance to shine.

fractal,,,"The biggest disruption today, in CPG and Retail, isn’t a new food or beauty product; it’s ChatGPT. It’s changing how people shop.

For Mrunali, this shift captures the excitement of leading in an industry where AI is reshaping the path to purchase. Drawing from her early training in consumer insights, she has built a philosophy centered on one truth: every successful solution must start and end with people.

As Chief Practice Officer at Fractal, Mrunali has championed this approach by integrating AI and engineering into business solutions while keeping business decision-makers at the center. Guided by client centricity, trust, and a culture of learning, she thrives on solving complex problems. More importantly, she finds joy in watching teams grow while using technology for sustainable social good.

Her leadership mantra is simple yet bold: do the right thing, not just the easy thing; take risks but provide a safety net for your team; and lead with authenticity, in work and in life.

Her message for CPG and Retail companies is clear: agility wins!

Those who adopt AI to understand and relate to consumers faster than ever before will own the marketplace.

Nearly two decades ago, Devendra, a young consultant, learned a lesson that would change everything: ""The model doesn’t matter if it doesn’t impact decisions."" The goal wasn’t to build better models, it was to drive better decisions.

It wasn't about creating the perfect algorithm. It was about understanding and empowering the human on the other side of the screen to make a better choice.

His journey spanned continents. Mumbai taught resilience and innovation under pressure. Singapore and UK revealed how diverse cultures tackle problems uniquely. In the US, Devendra experienced the swift advancement of AI up close, working alongside some of the brightest minds in the industry.

Three moments defined his transformation:

𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭, when technical perfection gave way to business impact. The realization that perfect model metrics mean nothing if it doesn't help drive a better decision.

𝐒𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐝, being the smartest person in the room became less rewarding than empowering others. Seeing a team member ace a critical presentation became more rewarding than any personal win.

𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐫𝐝, saying ‘yes’ to every client request gave way to asking ‘why’. Challenging status quo led to deeper conversations, stronger solutions, and partnerships that truly moved the needle.

Today, Devendra guides hi-tech enterprises through a landscape where AI is widely discussed but rarely implemented at scale to realize its full potential. His approach is refreshingly simple: start with purpose, build trust through transparency, and embed insights directly where decisions are made.

His philosophy? Whether it's a client partnership, a team, or a community, leave it better than you found it.

Because the best leaders don't just climb ladders, they build bridges for others to cross.

“As we welcomed our baby girl into the world, I wanted to gift my wife something that truly reflected the depth of my gratitude. That’s when I chose a pair of sustainable, lab-grown diamond earrings.

As I held our daughter in my arms, I realized no material gift could ever fully express what I felt. But I wanted to try, by choosing something intentional. Something that carried meaning.

The diamond represents the timeless strength and beauty of our love, while also aligning with my values of sustainability and purpose.

In a world where values shine as brightly as style, lab-grown diamonds are more than just stunning; they’re meaningful. Ethically created, planet-friendly, and every bit as radiant as their mined counterparts. These gems are a tribute to the modern woman: confident, conscious, and uncompromising.

When my wife opened the box, her eyes sparkled, not just with joy, but with recognition. It was a reflection of who we are and the future we’re building for our daughter, rooted in mindful choices and lasting love.

For us, it became something even more:
A quiet vow.
A promise to cherish the present, honor the future, and let our values lead the way.

A bit of context:
At Fractal, we do things a little differently. Like most great companies, we love celebrating the end of an amazing year and recognizing the incredible work everyone does. This time, we got something extra special – the freedom to choose our own annual holiday gift.

fractal,,,"“There’s a saying, ‘If you never enter the water, you’ll never learn how to swim.’ And from a very young age, I’ve always stepped into uncharted waters & figured my way through.

At 21, I moved abroad to fulfill my ‘big American dream’, complete my master’s & earn in dollars. But the world there was entirely different - new people, different cultures. I had to manage it all by myself. But the only thing that kept me going was video calls with my parents.

But as my assignments piled up, even those calls were reduced. Mom would always ask, ‘When are you coming home?’ I had no answer. I wanted to return home only after achieving something. So when I got a job as an Analyst, I immersed myself in learning everything. For the next few years, everything took a backseat.

During this time, I was introduced to Fractal; they were our AI partners. From the start, I was in awe of their work & people.

But right when I was thinking of making changes to my professional life, Dad called, ‘Your mom had a heart attack.’ I thought, ‘What was the point of this if I couldn’t be there for Mom?’ So I decided to move back to India. But the question remained, what about my job?

At that time, the only company I could think of was Fractal. I approached Srikanth, Fractal’s co-founder & he just said, ‘We would love to have you.’

And so, in 2018, I moved back to India. And that’s when I realized what I was truly missing - celebrating birthdays together, my sons understanding the true meaning of family & work has never felt more satisfying.

Since joining Fractal, I’ve had countless opportunities to grow. In fact, during Covid, I even got the opportunity to lead a task force to help the government manage health service responses. I could make a real difference. So I worked 18 hours a day, took 2 AM calls & even worked while I was down with Covid, to deliver on time. And I did. Within 24 hours, we built a platform that enabled govt of Karnataka to manage Covid operations efficiently.

And through it all, I’ve realized that success isn’t just about the milestones you reach - it’s about the people who stand by you & the memories you create together.”",Others,Personal

“I hadn’t planned anything for the holidays, but when Fractal decided to let us choose the holiday gift of our choice, something nudged me to do more. I decided to visit Maru Ghar, home to 130+ elderly residents who, despite always greeting visitors with warm smiles, often feel forgotten by society and their families.

What struck me immediately was the incredible warmth of the place. Despite everything they've endured, the residents create a joyful family atmosphere, sharing stories and laughing together over meals.

Talking to the wonderful people who looked after the young at heart, I was deeply moved. They spoke with so much love for the residents as if caring for their own family. Their humble, unwavering commitment was truly inspiring.

What makes Maru Ghar so special isn’t just the care they provide, but the sense of belonging they provide for those who’ve been left behind. It’s a place where every bit of support is transformed into warmth, respect, and community.

A li’l bit of context:

At Fractal, much like most good companies, we celebrated the end of another amazing year and the incredible work everyone accomplishes through an annual holiday gift.

James Davies took on the challenge of building something new in a world that had hit a standstill. But instead of waiting for clarity, he created it through conversations, curiosity, and a sharp focus on what really matters: client outcomes. Here’s what that looked like in action:

🔸 Insurance relies heavily on data, but it often lacks the personal touch needed to truly meet an individual's needs. When his team, taught AI to scan aerial photos after hurricanes, they weren't just being tech-savvy; they were ensuring that real people received help before they even had to ask.
🔸 His team's AI solution helped underwriters review more opportunities despite being buried in paperwork. Not because the technology was flashy, but because someone took the time to understand what people actually needed.

The magic isn't in complicated algorithms, it's in those casual ""hey, what if we tried this?"" conversations that happen between meetings. It's about putting clients first and thinking big while moving quickly.

""Comparison is the thief of joy,"" James often says. Instead of measuring yourself against others, why not pour that energy into making the most of what's right in front of you?

That's the approach that's changing how insurance works, making it less about paperwork and more about being there when it matters most.

If you haven’t heard of them, they’re this incredible organization that’s been looking after elderly folks in our community for about 15 years now. They don’t just provide meals – they’re creating real human connections, offering medical help, and bringing joy to people who often feel forgotten.

The Foundation sent over some photos of their ‘young at heart’ enjoying their meals together. The smiles, the conversation, the warmth in that room – it was everything. They have this remarkable ability to take contributions of any size and create moments of real connection and dignity.

What strikes me most about the Friends Care Foundation is how they’ve built something sustainable. They’re not just helping today – they’ve created a model that other organizations are following. Every elder who walks through their doors is treated like family.

fractal,Employee experience,Culture,"Prarthana’s journey began with data analysis, uncovering patterns. When her firm needed a Human Capital leader in Europe, she stepped forward, asking, ""Why not me?"" 

At first, leadership meant structure, designing processes, streamlining systems, and building frameworks to keep the organization humming. But Prarthana realized that true impact comes from blending data-driven insight with empathy and human connection. 

With experience across three continents, she has learned how culture shapes the way people work and connect and is able to translate global strategies into local action. Through initiatives like ‘Thriving Together’ and ‘EmpowerHER’, she’s built a workplace where people talk openly about mental health, support each other, and thrive. 

Her approach to leadership development is practical and inclusive: Whether it’s regional town halls, coffee mornings, or CSR initiatives, she creates moments that connect people and remind them they’re part of something bigger. 

She believes leadership isn’t about having all the answers but asking the right questions, and empowering others to discover their own solutions. 

In the fast-moving world of analytics and AI, Prarthana believes Human Capital’s role is to guide people through change, build learning pathways, and ensure innovation happens not just in technology, but in how people are supported and enabled to grow. 

When you lead with both mind and soul, you don’t just grow a business—you cultivate a culture where everyone has the chance to shine. 

Prarthana’s story is proof that when analytics meets empathy, leadership becomes a catalyst for human potential.

He examined how organizations can better leverage AI to re-skill their workforce, drive innovation, and design inclusive systems that benefit everyone.

In the first fireside chat, Shashi Reddy and Mrunali Majmudar unpacked what it truly means to be an AI-ready organization. It’s not just about having the right tools, it’s about aligning data strategy, governance, and security with a culture that’s open to transformation. From balancing quick wins with long-term bets to building trust in AI-driven decisions, they emphasized that people and processes matter just as much as platforms.

Kevin McCurdy joined Dylan Dias to discuss the infrastructure needed to move AI from pilot to production. The session explored how enterprise-grade AI demands more than compute, calls for hybrid cloud-edge models, and thoughtful orchestration. Cost-performance optimization, scalability, and governance are now inseparable from AI success, and enterprises that get this right will lead the next wave of transformation.

The final session, featuring Scott Engle and Himanshu Nautiyal, spotlighted the rise of autonomous AI agents. These aren’t just tools to automate tasks, they’re evolving into intelligent collaborators capable of driving enterprise outcomes. Scaling them requires more than tech readiness. It demands new operating models, trust frameworks, and a willingness to reimagine workflows from the ground up.

Together, these conversations painted a picture of where enterprise AI is heading and what it takes to lead the way.

Nearly two decades ago, Devendra, a young consultant, learned a lesson that would change everything: ""The model doesn’t matter if it doesn’t impact decisions."" The goal wasn’t to build better models, it was to drive better decisions.

It wasn't about creating the perfect algorithm. It was about understanding and empowering the human on the other side of the screen to make a better choice.

His journey spanned continents. Mumbai taught resilience and innovation under pressure. Singapore and UK revealed how diverse cultures tackle problems uniquely. In the US, Devendra experienced the swift advancement of AI up close, working alongside some of the brightest minds in the industry.

Three moments defined his transformation:

𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭, when technical perfection gave way to business impact. The realization that perfect model metrics mean nothing if it doesn't help drive a better decision.

𝐒𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐝, being the smartest person in the room became less rewarding than empowering others. Seeing a team member ace a critical presentation became more rewarding than any personal win.

𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐫𝐝, saying ‘yes’ to every client request gave way to asking ‘why’. Challenging status quo led to deeper conversations, stronger solutions, and partnerships that truly moved the needle.
 
Today, Devendra guides hi-tech enterprises through a landscape where AI is widely discussed but rarely implemented at scale to realize its full potential. His approach is refreshingly simple: start with purpose, build trust through transparency, and embed insights directly where decisions are made.

His philosophy? Whether it's a client partnership, a team, or a community, leave it better than you found it.

Because the best leaders don't just climb ladders, they build bridges for others to cross.

As part of our EmpowerHer series, Mythreyi Mukund recently led a powerful conversation on 'Building Resilience and Overcoming Imposter Syndrome' with two leaders who’ve truly walked this journey - Catherine Ewbank and Yogita Kaushik.

Here’s what stood out:

🔸 Imposter syndrome often drives us to prove ourselves: longer hours, extra certifications, pushing harder. For women in tech, there’s a unique pressure to constantly validate their expertise. With so few women in engineering and tech, unconscious bias means you often have to demonstrate your tech credentials over and over again.
🔸 The key to overcoming it? Start by acknowledging your success. Don’t deflect praise; share it. Feedback from others helps break down self-doubt and build authentic confidence.
🔸 Reach out - to leadership, a mentor, or your team. Putting yourself out there is a bold act of resilience.
🔸 Normalizing these feelings within teams is critical. Open conversations create safe spaces. Allyship matters.

A gentle reminder: Don’t be too harsh on yourself. Impostor syndrome may never fully disappear - it’s part of being human, and it can even drive growth. Embrace being uncomfortable with not knowing. That’s where transformation begins.

Thank you to our inspiring panelists and everyone who joined the conversation. Let’s keep building each other up.

The diamond represents the timeless strength and beauty of our love, while also aligning with my values of sustainability and purpose.

In a world where values shine as brightly as style, lab-grown diamonds are more than just stunning; they’re meaningful. Ethically created, planet-friendly, and every bit as radiant as their mined counterparts. These gems are a tribute to the modern woman: confident, conscious, and uncompromising.

When my wife opened the box, her eyes sparkled, not just with joy, but with recognition. It was a reflection of who we are and the future we’re building for our daughter, rooted in mindful choices and lasting love.

For us, it became something even more: 
A quiet vow. 
A promise to cherish the present, honor the future, and let our values lead the way.


A bit of context: 
At Fractal, we do things a little differently. Like most great companies, we love celebrating the end of an amazing year and recognizing the incredible work everyone does. This time, we got something extra special – the freedom to choose our own annual holiday gift.

Some of us chose gifts for ourselves, some for our loved ones. Others saw it as a chance to support local artisans or make a difference. It wasn't just about getting a gift but about making a difference.

Stay tuned for more such stories.

Srikanth Velamakanni opened with a powerful vision of AI evolving into intelligent agents, and why adaptability is now the enterprise edge.

Tina Fordham, in conversation with Mrunali Majmudar (Sathe), highlighted why geopolitics has become a core C-suite priority, and how leaders can stay resilient in an increasingly volatile world.

Joydeep Saha, Imran Razzaq, and Himanshu Nautiyal unpacked AI agents in action - where they shine, where they fall short, and what must change to scale them responsibly.

Ganesh Venkatesh, Amit Gawali, and Mythreyi Mukund reframed the ROI conversation, sharing what it really takes to unlock business value from GenAI.

Huge thanks to our speakers and everyone who joined us - for your questions, curiosity, and openness.

We left inspired, not just by where AI is going, but by what it takes to lead through the noise.

fractal,,,"“There’s a saying, ‘If you never enter the water, you’ll never learn how to swim.’ And from a very young age, I’ve always stepped into uncharted waters & figured my way through.
 
At 21, I moved abroad to fulfill my ‘big American dream’, complete my master’s & earn in dollars. But the world there was entirely different - new people, different cultures. I had to manage it all by myself. But the only thing that kept me going was video calls with my parents.
 
But as my assignments piled up, even those calls were reduced. Mom would always ask, ‘When are you coming home?’ I had no answer. I wanted to return home only after achieving something. So when I got a job as an Analyst, I immersed myself in learning everything. For the next few years, everything took a backseat.
 
During this time, I was introduced to Fractal; they were our AI partners. From the start, I was in awe of their work & people.
 
But right when I was thinking of making changes to my professional life, Dad called, ‘Your mom had a heart attack.’ I thought, ‘What was the point of this if I couldn’t be there for Mom?’ So I decided to move back to India. But the question remained, what about my job?
 
At that time, the only company I could think of was Fractal. I approached Srikanth, Fractal’s co-founder & he just said, ‘We would love to have you.’
 
And so, in 2018, I moved back to India. And that’s when I realized what I was truly missing - celebrating birthdays together, my sons understanding the true meaning of family & work has never felt more satisfying.
 
Since joining Fractal, I’ve had countless opportunities to grow. In fact, during Covid, I even got the opportunity to lead a task force to help the government manage health service responses. I could make a real difference. So I worked 18 hours a day, took 2 AM calls & even worked while I was down with Covid, to deliver on time. And I did. Within 24 hours, we built a platform that enabled govt of Karnataka to manage Covid operations efficiently.
 
And through it all, I’ve realized that success isn’t just about the milestones you reach - it’s about the people who stand by you & the memories you create together.”

“I hadn’t planned anything for the holidays, but when Fractal decided to let us choose the holiday gift of our choice, something nudged me to do more. I decided to visit Maru Ghar, home to 130+ elderly residents who, despite always greeting visitors with warm smiles, often feel forgotten by society and their families. 

What struck me immediately was the incredible warmth of the place. Despite everything they've endured, the residents create a joyful family atmosphere, sharing stories and laughing together over meals. 

Talking to the wonderful people who looked after the young at heart, I was deeply moved. They spoke with so much love for the residents as if caring for their own family. Their humble, unwavering commitment was truly inspiring. 

What makes Maru Ghar so special isn’t just the care they provide, but the sense of belonging they provide for those who’ve been left behind. It’s a place where every bit of support is transformed into warmth, respect, and community. 

A li’l bit of context: 

At Fractal, much like most good companies, we celebrated the end of another amazing year and the incredible work everyone accomplishes through an annual holiday gift.

James Davies took on the challenge of building something new in a world that had hit a standstill. But instead of waiting for clarity, he created it through conversations, curiosity, and a sharp focus on what really matters: client outcomes. Here’s what that looked like in action:

🔸 Insurance relies heavily on data, but it often lacks the personal touch needed to truly meet an individual's needs. When his team, taught AI to scan aerial photos after hurricanes, they weren't just being tech-savvy; they were ensuring that real people received help before they even had to ask. 
🔸 His team's AI solution helped underwriters review more opportunities despite being buried in paperwork. Not because the technology was flashy, but because someone took the time to understand what people actually needed.

The magic isn't in complicated algorithms, it's in those casual ""hey, what if we tried this?"" conversations that happen between meetings. It's about putting clients first and thinking big while moving quickly.
 
""Comparison is the thief of joy,"" James often says. Instead of measuring yourself against others, why not pour that energy into making the most of what's right in front of you?

That's the approach that's changing how insurance works, making it less about paperwork and more about being there when it matters most.

""Every year, we get a holiday gift at Fractal. This year, we were given a choice in how to use it. And while picking something for myself would've been nice, I kept thinking about the ‘Friends Care Foundation’ and the amazing work they do. 

If you haven't heard of them, they're this incredible organization that's been looking after elderly folks in our community for about 15 years now. They don't just provide meals – they're creating real human connections, offering medical help, and bringing joy to people who often feel forgotten. 

The Foundation sent over some photos of their ‘young at heart’ enjoying their meals together. The smiles, the conversation, the warmth in that room – it was everything. They have this remarkable ability to take contributions of any size and create moments of real connection and dignity. 

What strikes me most about the Friends Care Foundation is how they've built something sustainable. They're not just helping today – they've created a model that other organizations are following. Every elder who walks through their doors is treated like family. 

I'm so grateful that Fractal's holiday initiative led me here. But the real heroes? The people at Friends Care who show up every day, year after year, making life better for our community elders.”

Model Context Protocol (MCP) solves this by providing an open standard for secure, consistent communication between AI models and enterprise systems.

In our latest blog post, Abhijit Guha, PhD and Amol Bandagale explain:
➡️ Why the Anthropic-proposed MCP standard is gaining momentum, with support from all the major players such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI.
➡️ How MCP connects AI Agents with AI models, tools, applications and any other company resources through a simple and open architecture.
➡️ How MCP is emerging as the cornerstone of enterprise AI, enabling organizations to deploy agentic systems at scale.

How do you strike this balance in your work?

Akhil Behl sat down with Microsoft's Jerome Rose at Shoptalk 2025 to answer this critical question. They discussed practical approaches for navigating the AI landscape.
 
Some interesting insights were covered - 
🔸Balancing governance with crucial experimentation. 
🔸Why internal operations are often the best starting point for AI implementation. 
🔸What's next as AI evolves for forecasting, computer vision, and more.

“I still remember how excited I used to get as a kid whenever we'd pass through Pipli on our way from Bhubaneswar to Puri. This little town was like an explosion of colors and creativity that always caught my eye. Those memories came flooding back during my recent trip to Odisha.

Things have changed now. The new highway completely bypasses Pipli, and as I took a detour to visit the town, I could immediately sense something was different. The once-bustling streets seemed quieter, with fewer visitors wandering through.

I decided to explore the narrow lanes where shops displayed the famous appliqué work (ornamental needlework in which pieces or patches of fabric are sewn or stuck onto a larger piece to form a picture or pattern). Each ‘𝘊𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘥𝘶𝘢’ (traditional appliqué textile) tells its own story through vibrant patterns and intricate stitching. What struck me most was how generations of craftsmanship were woven into every piece.

In one of the workshops, I noticed an elderly artisan working in peaceful silence. When he saw me admiring his creations, his face lit up with a warm smile. When I enquired about the mellow turnaround, he proudly said, moving his fingers in a rhythmic movement through the fabric, ‘We continue to create our works of art, even if fewer come.’

We chatted as he worked, and I learned how the new highway had dramatically reduced foot traffic through town. Yet here he was, creating with the same passion and precision as his ancestors had for centuries.

I knew I wanted the beautiful ‘𝘊𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘥𝘶𝘢’ showing Lord Jagannath as Krishna. The detail was breathtaking - each stitch placed with devotion and skill. This wasn't just a souvenir; it was a piece of Odisha's soul. Every stitch preserves a tradition that has been part of Odisha's identity for centuries.

Sometimes, the most meaningful connections happen when we take the road less travelled. When we slow down to appreciate the quiet dedication of people who continue creating beauty, even when the world rushes by on newer, faster roads.”

The shop was run by Hasib uncle, a super sweet elderly man who was excited to show me around. He told me how he learned carpet-making from his parents and how each piece has its own story. He helped me find the perfect carpet - one with these earthy and elegant designs that just felt right.
As we chatted, I learned something cool. Hasib uncle wasn't just selling carpets. He was using this work to support his nieces' education. How amazing is that? By continuing this traditional craft, he was helping his family build a better future.

This whole experience was pretty special. I only wish I had clicked a picture with him to remember this.

fractal,,,"From selling CPG products to leading SaaS teams, Beenaâ€™s career has been a masterclass in one thing: leading with respect!

Her philosophy - Your team is your strength. Give them space to grow, coach them when needed, and always put clients first. At Fractal, that mindset has led to 100% client retention and glowing, unpaid reviews on Gartner Peer Insights.

But leadership isnâ€™t just about driving business, itâ€™s about building trust. Across North America, India, ASEAN, and the UK, Beena has seen one universal truth: proactive, timely communication is what keeps relationships strong, even when challenges arise.

Now, as part of UNESCOâ€™s Women for Ethical AI initiative, sheâ€™s championing Responsible AI, not as an afterthought, but from the data up. Because without inclusive, ethical AI, businesses risk building solutions that donâ€™t work in the real world.

And AI? It continues to surprise her.

ðŸ”¹In Marketing, she sees AI cutting the chaos in agency-client collaboration (goodbye, 6:30 PM brief + 12-hour turnaround).

ðŸ”¹In Product, AI is shrinking the time from concept to code.

ðŸ”¹In Manufacturing, AI is becoming the creative partner for design innovation.

But through all the tech, Beenaâ€™s leadership philosophy remains simple: Be the frame, let your team be the picture. Lift them up, own the setbacks, celebrate their success, and never lose your sense of wonder.

As AI continues to shape the future, Beena believes one thing is clear: not interacting with GenAI is no longer an option. The tools are here, the costs are dropping, now is the time to integrate AI into business and get the best out of existing investments.

fractal,,,"I grew up in Mumbai, the â€˜city of dreams,â€™ though for us, it was more about surviving than dreaming. My dad was an auto-driver & mom was a housewife. Although she didnâ€™t have a formal education, she gave me everything she could. My only ambition was to grow up & get a decent job.

Like many kids in the slums, I did odd jobs - packing bangles or running documents for an insurance company. There, I saw people working on computers & thought, â€˜Important people work on computers.â€™ I wanted to be one of them.

But all my dreams took a backseat when I lost my mother. It was a difficult time. My grades took a hitâ€¦It wasnâ€™t until after 12th grade when my friends started planning their future, that I realized I needed to act. So I enrolled in a BSc in IT at a local college.

In my final year, I accompanied a friend to a job interview at Fractal. I had no expectations; But seeing him, even I decided to try for the role. That whim changed my life - I got selected. My 1st salary felt like a fortune. For me, it was more than just a job. You see, I didnâ€™t even know how to use Excel on my 1st day, but my manager saw potential in me. He mentored me & pushed me to think outside the box. And within 8 months, I was automating processes & handling projects.

4 years later, my manager asked if Iâ€™d like to go to the US for a project. But I didnâ€™t even have a passport. He encouraged me, & in 2016, I boarded my 1st flight to the US. I instantly fell in love with the work culture, the lifestyle & the people. So in 2017, I moved my family to Chicago.

It was a transformative time - not just for my career but for my life. I climbed the work ladder, led global projects for Fractal, & solved impossible challenges. But my proudest moment wasnâ€™t any of that. It was standing in the house I bought for my dad - a real home, something weâ€™d only dreamed of. I looked around & thought, â€˜If only Mom could see this.â€™

Today, Iâ€™m the Customer Success Lead at Fractalâ€™s Chicago office - a far cry from where I began. And if a boy from the slums of Mumbai can make it this far, I believe anyone can. Because the thing about dreams is, with hard work, they become a reality!

At the recently held Mumbai Tech Week, Srikanth spoke about AIâ€™s transformative impact - especially in healthcare, a sector where AI is making the biggest difference.

He shared how, alongside Prashant Warier, they approached AI in healthcare by working backwards from the user problem - starting with genomics and radiology to tackle some of the most pressing medical challenges.

One example? Tuberculosis.
India, unfortunately, is the Tuberculosis capital of the world - but AI can diagnose it early with just a chest X-ray.

Qure.ai, a Fractal company, has already touched 25 million lives by enabling faster, more accurate screenings across the globe. From early cancer detection to better diagnosis, it is redefining healthcare.

A key takeaway from Srikanth that young entrepreneurs should remember to work towards making a difference

Your pets love you unconditionally. And we do everything we can to love them back.

But what about pet food brands? Are they showing that same care and understanding as you would?

One of the largest pet food manufacturers in the U.S. asked that very question. Instead of relying on assumptions, they wanted to truly understand pet parents - what they value, how they choose, and what their pets actually need.

With Customer Genomics, they transformed scattered data into deep insights, helping them personalize nutrition solutions for millions of pets.

As loving our pets isnâ€™t just about treats and toys. Itâ€™s about knowing them better. And when brands get it right, everybody wins - especially the ones with the wagging tails.

95% of decision-making happens in the subconscious mind, driven by emotions. Yet most AI solutions today focus only on logic and efficiency. Without AI systems that embed emotional intelligence, enterprises risk making disconnected, mechanical choices.

Fractal is designing an AI system that doesnâ€™t just analyze data but understands human emotions - helping leaders make more empathetic, strategic, and impactful decisions.

latentview,Thought Leadership - Flagship,Authored Aricles,"AI is no longer an application. It’s becoming the infrastructure of progress.
This message was clear at NVIDIA’s GTC in DC, where every discussion focused on how industries are rebuilding around data, compute, and efficiency.

Here are the 5 industry forward viewpoints shared by our business head, Parijat Banerjee, who attended the event:

- Finance: AI is moving beyond automation into collaboration. Federated learning is enabling leading banks to train shared fraud models without exchanging sensitive data, cutting detection times from days to minutes.
- Healthcare: AI is helping doctors and nurses reclaim time by automating tasks and enabling ambient listening to focus on patients. Eli Lilly and Schrödinger are using digital twins to accelerate trials and lower costs.
- Industry and Energy: Companies like NVIDIA, Foxconn, and Schneider are designing “AI factories” that blend compute, robotics, and power. 
- Science and Space: NVIDIA and the US Department of Energy are building seven national AI supercomputers to accelerate breakthroughs in quantum, materials, and biopharma. 
A key vision: Nobel Prize–worthy research in hours rather than decades within the next decade.
- Technology: The focus is shifting from experimentation to efficiency — cloud, cost, and compute. 

But amid all the promise, one reminder stood out: AI is good with 80%, but struggles with the 20% — human judgment, empathy, and context.
The next phase of growth will belong to those who teach their systems to learn responsibly with data that is contextual, collaborative, and inclusive.
Compute is the new steel. Data is the new currency. The future of intelligence must stay human-centered.

A Zinnov report notes that 40–50% of India-based GCCs are now focused on R&D, AI, analytics, and product innovation—developing solutions that were once the domain of global HQs. “The conversation has moved beyond operational efficiency to delivering strategic impact… making innovation non-negotiable,” said Ayushi Jain, GCC head at LatentView Analytics.

From Mercedes-Benz India’s GenAI model predicting vehicle paint needs to Walmart Global Tech India’s AI-powered retail optimisation, these centres are building products and enabling topline growth. Over 185 GCCs have set up AI/ML centres of excellence, with LatentView helping companies identify “low-hanging fruit” to fund future innovation. “It’s about improving operational efficiency first, then using resources to fuel innovation,” said Krishnan Venkata, Chief Client Officer at LatentView.

Tier-2 cities like Indore, Mysuru, and Bhubaneswar are joining Bengaluru as GCC hubs, with operating costs 40–60% lower and attrition rates 30–40% lower. But scaling in newer regions, attracting top talent, and shifting from execution to strategic partnership remain challenges. “Many GCCs still function as execution arms rather than strategic partners,” said Rajan Sethuraman, CEO of LatentView Analytics. The future, he added, lies in fostering integration, experimentation, and domain-specific AI expertise to deliver measurable business outcomes.
