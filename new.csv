"Why has hiring become so slow — even when the need is urgent?

Hiring isn’t slowing down because of a talent shortage — it’s slowing down because decision-making has become more complex than ever.

Across companies, we’re seeing the same patterns:

⚠️Roles that aren’t fully aligned internally
⚠️Interview loops are getting longer
⚠️Leaders are hesitating to close
⚠️Teams waiting for “perfect” instead of “right”
