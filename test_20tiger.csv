At the Consumer Pricing & Revenue Growth Management Summit Europe, our team led a hands-on workshop on Interconnected RGM, co-hosted by Claudius Roth from Imperial Brands. Together, we explored what it takes to operationalize RGM at scale, from governance frameworks that hold across regions to data-driven flexibility that adapts to market realities.

The session brought together RGM leaders and practitioners who shared real examples of how pricing, promotions, and portfolio decisions evolve when insight flows seamlessly across teams. Key discussions included:
➡️ Practical frameworks for scaling RGM capabilities.
➡️ Success stories that show what works and what doesn’t in global execution.
➡️ A case study that unpacked the tension between global consistency and local agility.

Zahid Hossain, AVP – Global Business at Tiger Analytics, also joined a panel on Vendor–Retailer collaboration, emphasizing how shared insights and structured communication are essential to move from negotiation to partnership.

It was great to connect with leaders shaping the future of RGM through innovation, collaboration, and practical execution. Thanks to everyone who joined and contributed.

Every project adds a new piece to your stack: Some test your optimization skills, while others stretch your design thinking. Each one shapes how you approach the next move. The pace quickens, the board fills up, but with every fit, you see the pattern forming. 

At Tiger Analytics, it’s the variety across projects and domains that helps us level up – optimizing demand forecasts for global retailers with probabilistic ML models, fine-tuning recommender systems for edge latency, designing LLM agents for claims processing in insurance, generating synthetic data to test fraud models in banking, and building retrieval-augmented pipelines for faster insight generation in manufacturing. Add in peer-led learning, open design reviews, and deep dives across data science, MLOps, and platform engineering, and you get the perfect alignment between skill, curiosity, and growth.

At Tiger Analytics, we believe true transformation requires a bold vision. At the upcoming Chicago CDAO Executive Summit, our team will share practical strategies for embedding AI into core operations, equipping attendees with actionable frameworks to inspire ambitious, organization-wide change.

We're focused on helping leaders:
🔸 Move from Automation to Autonomy: It's not just about improving old workflows, but creating entirely new, intelligent, and autonomous ways of operating with Agentic AI.
🔸 Build an AI-Native Foundation: We architect the resilient data ecosystems and robust governance frameworks that allow you to innovate safely and scale with confidence.
🔸 Drive Strategic Transformation: We partner with you to identify and execute on opportunities where AI can redefine business models and create an enduring competitive advantage.

The future belongs to those who don't just adopt AI, but build their entire enterprise around it. This foundation should be seen as a renewable competitive edge, evolving through continuous cycles of reinvention, measurement, and reinvestment. By embracing enterprise-wide AI as an ongoing journey rather than a one-time leap, leaders are better positioned to adapt and thrive in an ever-changing digital landscape.

🔸Reimagine: Unlock true value by thinking beyond individual tasks and isolated use cases to reimagine entire processes from tech support to data management.

🔸 Building data credibility across commercial teams
🔸 Balancing automation with human oversight
🔸 Embedding RGM practices into everyday decisions. Thanks to Prashant for partnering with us at this event and sharing his experience and success story. It reinforced Tiger’s leadership in the pricing space and the value we deliver to the global pricing community.

What emerged from this discussion across healthcare, banking, and nutrition industries:

🔸 The focus is shifting from simply finding AI use cases to prioritizing the ones that align closely with specific business goals
🔸 Significant disruption opportunities exist even in highly regulated industries like banking and pediatric nutrition
🔸The real hurdles that leave AI stuck at the experimentation phase: unclear KPIs and lack of integration with core business functions
🔸 Implementing robust guardrails and governance systems is crucial for managing AI deployments at scale

Key takeaways:
▸ AI’s impact is clearest when grounded in precise, business-specific use cases. Our panelists expanded on how we spot these high-value opportunities by aligning AI efforts closely with operational pain points and measurable outcomes.

▸ Scaling AI requires operational maturity, with seamless alignment across teams and systems. Our panel shared the enterprise approach to navigating infrastructure gaps, and cross-functional adoption, successfully moving from pilot to production.

▸ Resilient leadership is key to navigating uncertainty. Shaurya Chakra winner, Col. Shankar Vembu reflected on leading through crisis and the evolving role of AI in military operations.

"tiger",,,"Adopting the right solution architecture is a critical factor in the success of your GenAI adoption. Not every use case requires training a foundation model from scratch â€” so how do data leaders determine the best fit?

In an earlier post, we covered the six questions that help shape a successful GenAI strategy. Once those foundational questions are addressed, the next step is selecting an effective approach for implementation.

Foundation âž¡ï¸_x008f_ Implementation - Key factors to consider:
- Solution type: An enterprise model API may be enough, while some use cases require fine-tuning open-source models or building custom solutions.
- Scalability & cost: Striking the right balance between customization, performance, and long-term viability.
- Risk management: Identifying potential risks at each stage and planning mitigation strategies.

We recommend revisiting the use cases identified when planning your GenAI integration, bringing in the right technical leadership from within the organization, and engaging experienced AI-based solution providers when needed.

A structured approach ensures GenAI delivers real value, without unnecessary complexity or costs. Explore our guide: https://lnkd.in/gjxxjz5Y

As part of our Womenâ€™s Day celebrations this month, we hosted a panel on March 6, featuring Shreyas Narayan, Sunitha Gunasekaran, Aswathy Augus, and Sandeep Yeddu of the #TigerTribe, to bring a fresh perspective on how we approach these challenges.

Some takeaways:

ðŸ“_x008d_ Work-Life Harmony: The perfect balance is a myth. Itâ€™s all about finding a rhythm that works for you â€“ one that is personal, context-driven, and evolves with time. Most importantly, donâ€™t hesitate to ask for help, whether at home or work.

ðŸ“_x008d_ Risk-Taking: Every career move involves a trade-off between risk and regret. Early in our careers, weâ€™re quick to take risks, but with time, appetites change. The key is calculating risks to protect what matters most, while still embracing opportunities for growth.

ðŸ“_x008d_ Imposter Syndrome: Everyone has those â€œam I good enough?â€_x009d_ moments, but they donâ€™t define us. Instead, we can turn them into opportunities for growth, learning, and building the confidence to push past self-doubt.
