"Fractal",,,"From harmless ragging to raising hands - some traditions just evolve, not end.

In the early days of Fractal, Fridays meant TGIF sessions - where new joiners (yes, even Srikanth and Pranay!) were welcomed with some light-hearted “ragging” and banter. 

As Natwar Mall and Raj Aradhyula reflect, that tradition has matured into our weekly town halls, a space where every voice is heard, every question is welcomed, and the spirit of community stays alive. 

College vibes may have faded, but the culture? Still thriving.

""Every year, we get a holiday gift at Fractal. This year, we were given a choice in how to use it. And while picking something for myself would've been nice, I kept thinking about the ‘Friends Care Foundation’ and the amazing work they do. 

If you haven't heard of them, they're this incredible organization that's been looking after elderly folks in our community for about 15 years now. They don't just provide meals – they're creating real human connections, offering medical help, and bringing joy to people who often feel forgotten. 

The Foundation sent over some photos of their ‘young at heart’ enjoying their meals together. The smiles, the conversation, the warmth in that room – it was everything. They have this remarkable ability to take contributions of any size and create moments of real connection and dignity. 

What strikes me most about the Friends Care Foundation is how they've built something sustainable. They're not just helping today – they've created a model that other organizations are following. Every elder who walks through their doors is treated like family. 

I'm so grateful that Fractal's holiday initiative led me here. But the real heroes? The people at Friends Care who show up every day, year after year, making life better for our community elders.”

He highlighted how industries are embracing technology, citing L'Oreal’s transformation into a “beauty tech company” and MasterCard’s evolution into a “tech company in financial services.” This trend signals a profound shift- Technology is now the core of every industry.

However, the crucial challenge remains on how to turn this tech-first vision into tangible results.

Srikanth emphasized that this is where companies like Fractal step in, bridging the gap between AI potential and real-world impact. Whether it is boosting top-line growth, enhancing operational efficiency or transforming customer experiences, AI’s true value lies in its effective implementation.

"Fractal",,,"Attending the first-ever World Health Summit Regional Meeting in India - it’s been a great experience so far!

Many conversations here are so relevant to the work we’re doing with Vaidya.ai at Fractal - using AI for inclusive and accessible healthcare.

Scaling access, reducing bias in AI, building ethical regulatory frameworks, and reaching rural populations through tech aren’t just abstract ideas but they’re real,urgent challenges. 

Glad to be here, meeting and learning from people across the ecosystem who are all pushing toward better health for all!

"Fractal",,,"As agentic AI evolves, a key challenge lies in connecting agents with enterprise systems. By default, AI agents operate in silos, limiting their potential scope and, therefore, potential use cases.

Model Context Protocol (MCP) solves this by providing an open standard for secure, consistent communication between AI models and enterprise systems.

In our latest blog post, Abhijit Guha, PhD and Amol Bandagale explain:
➡️ Why the Anthropic-proposed MCP standard is gaining momentum, with support from all the major players such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI.
➡️ How MCP connects AI Agents with AI models, tools, applications and any other company resources through a simple and open architecture.
➡️ How MCP is emerging as the cornerstone of enterprise AI, enabling organizations to deploy agentic systems at scale.

"Fractal",,,"Here’s a holiday gift that rekindled forgotten passion :

“I remember how much I loved cricket as a child. It wasn’t just a hobby; it was my everything. Over time, that love quietly faded into the background until Fractal’s holiday gifting brought it all rushing back.

While contemplating what I wanted for the holidays, memories of my cricket-obsessed younger self came to mind. All I needed was the perfect place to fulfill my dream of buying a beautiful Cricket bat.

Each Cricket bat they craft is a labor of love, shaped by artisans who’ve honed their skills over generations. Their passion and craftsmanship shone through in every detail, making each piece more than just sports gear. It’s a story, a legacy, and a tribute to tradition.

For me, the bat became more than just a holiday gift. It celebrated authentic craftsmanship, of keeping a beautiful art form alive, and in a way, reliving my childhood memories of Christmas mornings and the joy of unwrapping a new cricket bat.”

“I still remember how excited I used to get as a kid whenever we'd pass through Pipli on our way from Bhubaneswar to Puri. This little town was like an explosion of colors and creativity that always caught my eye. Those memories came flooding back during my recent trip to Odisha.

Things have changed now. The new highway completely bypasses Pipli, and as I took a detour to visit the town, I could immediately sense something was different. The once-bustling streets seemed quieter, with fewer visitors wandering through.

I decided to explore the narrow lanes where shops displayed the famous appliqué work (ornamental needlework in which pieces or patches of fabric are sewn or stuck onto a larger piece to form a picture or pattern). Each ‘𝘊𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘥𝘶𝘢’ (traditional appliqué textile) tells its own story through vibrant patterns and intricate stitching. What struck me most was how generations of craftsmanship were woven into every piece.

In one of the workshops, I noticed an elderly artisan working in peaceful silence. When he saw me admiring his creations, his face lit up with a warm smile. When I enquired about the mellow turnaround, he proudly said, moving his fingers in a rhythmic movement through the fabric, ‘We continue to create our works of art, even if fewer come.’

We chatted as he worked, and I learned how the new highway had dramatically reduced foot traffic through town. Yet here he was, creating with the same passion and precision as his ancestors had for centuries.

I knew I wanted the beautiful ‘𝘊𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘥𝘶𝘢’ showing Lord Jagannath as Krishna. The detail was breathtaking - each stitch placed with devotion and skill. This wasn't just a souvenir; it was a piece of Odisha's soul. Every stitch preserves a tradition that has been part of Odisha's identity for centuries.

Sometimes, the most meaningful connections happen when we take the road less travelled. When we slow down to appreciate the quiet dedication of people who continue creating beauty, even when the world rushes by on newer, faster roads.”

"Fractal",,,"Here's Rashmi Tiwari's throwback on the unique holiday gift she gifted herself!

""I was just walking by a small display near the mall when something caught my eye. Wow, handmade carpets! Each one was so colorful and had these amazing patterns that I couldn't look away. Right then and there, I knew I wanted to gift myself something special.

The shop was run by Hasib uncle, a super sweet elderly man who was excited to show me around. He told me how he learned carpet-making from his parents and how each piece has its own story. He helped me find the perfect carpet - one with these earthy and elegant designs that just felt right.
As we chatted, I learned something cool. Hasib uncle wasn't just selling carpets. He was using this work to support his nieces' education. How amazing is that? By continuing this traditional craft, he was helping his family build a better future.

This whole experience was pretty special. I only wish I had clicked a picture with him to remember this.

Thanks to fractal.ai giving us the freedom to choose our own holiday gifts, I didn't just buy a carpet. I connected with a story, supported a local artisan, and found something that means something to me.""

A bit of context :
At Fractal, we do things a little differently. Like most great companies, we love celebrating the end of an amazing year and recognizing the incredible work everyone does. This time, we got something extra special â€“ the freedom to choose our own annual holiday gift.

Some of us chose gifts for ourselves, some for our loved ones. Others saw it as a chance to support local artisans or make a difference. It wasn't just about getting a gift but about making a difference.

Stay tuned for more such stories.

"Fractal",,,"From selling CPG products to leading SaaS teams, Beenaâ€™s career has been a masterclass in one thing: leading with respect!

Her philosophy - Your team is your strength. Give them space to grow, coach them when needed, and always put clients first. At Fractal, that mindset has led to 100% client retention and glowing, unpaid reviews on Gartner Peer Insights.

But leadership isnâ€™t just about driving business, itâ€™s about building trust. Across North America, India, ASEAN, and the UK, Beena has seen one universal truth: proactive, timely communication is what keeps relationships strong, even when challenges arise.

Now, as part of UNESCOâ€™s Women for Ethical AI initiative, sheâ€™s championing Responsible AI, not as an afterthought, but from the data up. Because without inclusive, ethical AI, businesses risk building solutions that donâ€™t work in the real world.

And AI? It continues to surprise her.

ðŸ”¹In Marketing, she sees AI cutting the chaos in agency-client collaboration (goodbye, 6:30 PM brief + 12-hour turnaround).

ðŸ”¹In Product, AI is shrinking the time from concept to code.

ðŸ”¹In Manufacturing, AI is becoming the creative partner for design innovation.

But through all the tech, Beenaâ€™s leadership philosophy remains simple: Be the frame, let your team be the picture. Lift them up, own the setbacks, celebrate their success, and never lose your sense of wonder.

As AI continues to shape the future, Beena believes one thing is clear: not interacting with GenAI is no longer an option. The tools are here, the costs are dropping, now is the time to integrate AI into business and get the best out of existing investments.

"Fractal",,,"I grew up in Mumbai, the â€˜city of dreams,â€™ though for us, it was more about surviving than dreaming. My dad was an auto-driver & mom was a housewife. Although she didnâ€™t have a formal education, she gave me everything she could. My only ambition was to grow up & get a decent job.

Like many kids in the slums, I did odd jobs - packing bangles or running documents for an insurance company. There, I saw people working on computers & thought, â€˜Important people work on computers.â€™ I wanted to be one of them.

But all my dreams took a backseat when I lost my mother. It was a difficult time. My grades took a hitâ€¦It wasnâ€™t until after 12th grade when my friends started planning their future, that I realized I needed to act. So I enrolled in a BSc in IT at a local college.

In my final year, I accompanied a friend to a job interview at Fractal. I had no expectations; But seeing him, even I decided to try for the role. That whim changed my life - I got selected. My 1st salary felt like a fortune. For me, it was more than just a job. You see, I didnâ€™t even know how to use Excel on my 1st day, but my manager saw potential in me. He mentored me & pushed me to think outside the box. And within 8 months, I was automating processes & handling projects.

4 years later, my manager asked if Iâ€™d like to go to the US for a project. But I didnâ€™t even have a passport. He encouraged me, & in 2016, I boarded my 1st flight to the US. I instantly fell in love with the work culture, the lifestyle & the people. So in 2017, I moved my family to Chicago.

It was a transformative time - not just for my career but for my life. I climbed the work ladder, led global projects for Fractal, & solved impossible challenges. But my proudest moment wasnâ€™t any of that. It was standing in the house I bought for my dad - a real home, something weâ€™d only dreamed of. I looked around & thought, â€˜If only Mom could see this.â€™

Today, Iâ€™m the Customer Success Lead at Fractalâ€™s Chicago office - a far cry from where I began. And if a boy from the slums of Mumbai can make it this far, I believe anyone can. Because the thing about dreams is, with hard work, they become a reality!

At the recently held Mumbai Tech Week, Srikanth spoke about AIâ€™s transformative impact - especially in healthcare, a sector where AI is making the biggest difference.

He shared how, alongside Prashant Warier, they approached AI in healthcare by working backwards from the user problem - starting with genomics and radiology to tackle some of the most pressing medical challenges.

One example? Tuberculosis.
India, unfortunately, is the Tuberculosis capital of the world - but AI can diagnose it early with just a chest X-ray.

Qure.ai, a Fractal company, has already touched 25 million lives by enabling faster, more accurate screenings across the globe. From early cancer detection to better diagnosis, it is redefining healthcare.

A key takeaway from Srikanth that young entrepreneurs should remember to work towards making a difference

"Fractal",,,"If youâ€™re a pet parent, you know the feeling.

Your pets love you unconditionally. And we do everything we can to love them back.

But what about pet food brands? Are they showing that same care and understanding as you would?

One of the largest pet food manufacturers in the U.S. asked that very question. Instead of relying on assumptions, they wanted to truly understand pet parents - what they value, how they choose, and what their pets actually need.

With Customer Genomics, they transformed scattered data into deep insights, helping them personalize nutrition solutions for millions of pets.

As loving our pets isnâ€™t just about treats and toys. Itâ€™s about knowing them better. And when brands get it right, everybody wins - especially the ones with the wagging tails.

"Fractal",,,"Your data tells you the â€˜whatâ€™, but do you get the â€˜whyâ€™?

95% of decision-making happens in the subconscious mind, driven by emotions. Yet most AI solutions today focus only on logic and efficiency. Without AI systems that embed emotional intelligence, enterprises risk making disconnected, mechanical choices.

Fractal is designing an AI system that doesnâ€™t just analyze data but understands human emotions - helping leaders make more empathetic, strategic, and impactful decisions.

The discussion also focused on building a sustainable GenAI talent ecosystem that supports local industries while contributing to global innovation — alongside tackling challenges in infrastructure, governance, and readiness.

This message was clear at NVIDIA’s GTC in DC, where every discussion focused on how industries are rebuilding around data, compute, and efficiency.

Here are the 5 industry forward viewpoints shared by our business head, Parijat Banerjee, who attended the event:

- Finance: AI is moving beyond automation into collaboration. Federated learning is enabling leading banks to train shared fraud models without exchanging sensitive data, cutting detection times from days to minutes.
- Healthcare: AI is helping doctors and nurses reclaim time by automating tasks and enabling ambient listening to focus on patients. Eli Lilly and Schrödinger are using digital twins to accelerate trials and lower costs.
- Industry and Energy: Companies like NVIDIA, Foxconn, and Schneider are designing “AI factories” that blend compute, robotics, and power. 
- Science and Space: NVIDIA and the US Department of Energy are building seven national AI supercomputers to accelerate breakthroughs in quantum, materials, and biopharma. 
A key vision: Nobel Prize–worthy research in hours rather than decades within the next decade.
- Technology: The focus is shifting from experimentation to efficiency — cloud, cost, and compute. 

But amid all the promise, one reminder stood out: AI is good with 80%, but struggles with the 20% — human judgment, empathy, and context.
The next phase of growth will belong to those who teach their systems to learn responsibly with data that is contextual, collaborative, and inclusive.
Compute is the new steel. Data is the new currency. The future of intelligence must stay human-centered.

We’re excited to see how these shifts reshape industries.","Thought Leadership","Authority"

"LatentView",,,"Once viewed as cost-efficient back offices, India’s Global Capability Centres (GCCs) are now leading cutting-edge AI-driven R&D, product engineering, and digital transformation. A Zinnov report notes that 40–50% of India-based GCCs are now focused on R&D, AI, analytics, and product innovation—developing solutions that were once the domain of global HQs. “The conversation has moved beyond operational efficiency to delivering strategic impact… making innovation non-negotiable,” said Ayushi Jain, GCC head at LatentView Analytics.

From Mercedes-Benz India’s GenAI model predicting vehicle paint needs to Walmart Global Tech India’s AI-powered retail optimisation, these centres are building products and enabling topline growth. Over 185 GCCs have set up AI/ML centres of excellence, with LatentView helping companies identify “low-hanging fruit” to fund future innovation. “It’s about improving operational efficiency first, then using resources to fuel innovation,” said Krishnan Venkata, Chief Client Officer at LatentView.

Tier-2 cities like Indore, Mysuru, and Bhubaneswar are joining Bengaluru as GCC hubs, with operating costs 40–60% lower and attrition rates 30–40% lower. But scaling in newer regions, attracting top talent, and shifting from execution to strategic partnership remain challenges. “Many GCCs still function as execution arms rather than strategic partners,” said Rajan Sethuraman, CEO of LatentView Analytics. The future, he added, lies in fostering integration, experimentation, and domain-specific AI expertise to deliver measurable business outcomes.
